abstract = {Cancer, one of the leading causes of death worldwide, develops when the normal balance between mitosis and apoptosis is disrupted. The subsequently increased proliferation rate or decreased apoptosis rate of cells leads to uncontrolled cellular growth. Thus, the current aim of cancer research is to increase the apoptosis rate in tumor cells—while limiting the concurrent death of healthy cells—and to induce controlled apoptosis in abnormal cells. Staurosporine is a very potent inducer of apoptosis because it inhibits many different kinases. So far, many different kinase pathways of staurosporine-induced apoptosis have been discussed for various tumor entities.},

@article{McComb2019,
abstract = {Apoptosis is a complex multi-step process driven by caspase-dependent proteolytic cleavage cascades. Dysregulation of apoptosis promotes tumorigenesis and limits the efficacy of chemotherapy. To assess the complex interactions among caspases during apoptosis, we disrupted caspase-8, -9, -3, -7, or -6 and combinations thereof, using CRISPR-based genome editing in living human leukemia cells. While loss of apical initiator caspase-8 or -9 partially blocked extrinsic or intrinsic apoptosis, respectively, only combined loss of caspase-3 and -7 fully inhibited both apoptotic pathways, with no discernible effect of caspase-6 deficiency alone or in combination. Caspase-3/7 double knockout cells exhibited almost complete inhibition of caspase-8 or -9 activation. Furthermore, deletion of caspase-3 and -7 decreased mitochondrial depolarization and cytochrome c release upon apoptosis activation. Thus, activation of effector caspase-3 or -7 sets off explosive feedback amplification of upstream apoptotic events, which is a key feature of apoptotic signaling essential for efficient apoptotic cell death.},

abstract = {Wnt signaling regulates cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation throughout development and is aberrantly regulated in cancer. The pathway is activated when Wnt ligands bind to specific receptors on the cell surface, resulting in the stabilization and nuclear accumulation of the transcriptional co-activator $\beta$-catenin. Mathematical and computational models have been used to study the spatial and temporal regulation of the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway and to investigate the functional impact of mutations in key components. Such models range in complexity, from time-dependent, ordinary differential equations that describe the biochemical interactions between key pathway components within a single cell, to complex, multiscale models that incorporate the role of the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway target genes in tissue homeostasis and carcinogenesis. This review aims to summarize recent progress in mathematical modeling of the Wnt pathway and to highlight new biological results that could form the basis for future theoretical investigations designed to increase the utility of theoretical models of Wnt signaling in the biomedical arena.},

@article{Deming2006,
abstract = {It was first shown by Newmeyer and colleagues in the 1990s that the molecular events of apoptosis could be reconstituted in vitro using Xenopus egg extracts. When the egg extract is allowed to incubate at room temperature for an extended time, the biochemical events of apoptosis are activated spontaneously. The features of apoptosis in the Xenopus reconstitution system mimic those that occur in mammalian cells: Cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria, caspases are activated, cellular substrates are cleaved, and added nuclei are fragmented. Moreover, these apoptotic events can be inhibited by addition of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and conventional caspase inhibitors (e.g., ZVAD-fmk). The mitochondria, which are triggered to release cytochrome c by as-yet-unknown signals in the extract, are essential for induction of the spontaneous apoptotic program in these extracts. However, one can study the apoptotic events that occur downstream of mitochondrial cytochrome c release by preparing extracts devoid of membrane components (including mitochondria). When purified cytochrome c is added to such cytosolic extracts, biochemical markers of apoptosis (e.g., activation of caspases) can be monitored. The egg extract therefore offers a tractable system for studying either separately or together the events of apoptosis occurring upstream and downstream of the mitochondria.},

@article{Santos2019,
abstract = {Individual cells in clonal populations often respond differently to environmental changes; for binary phenotypes, such as cell death, this can be measured as a fractional response. These types of responses have been attributed to cell-intrinsic stochastic processes and variable abundances of biochemical constituents, such as proteins, but the influence of organelles is still under investigation. We use the response to TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and a new statistical framework for determining parameter influence on cell-to-cell variability through the inference of variance explained, DEPICTIVE, to demonstrate that variable mitochondria abundance correlates with cell survival and determines the fractional cell death response. By quantitative data analysis and modeling we attribute this effect to variable effective concentrations at the mitochondria surface of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax/Bak. Further, our study suggests that inhibitors of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, used in cancer treatment, may increase the diversity of cellular responses, enhancing resistance to treatment.},

abstract = {The EGF-stimulated ERK/MAPK pathway is a key conduit for cellular proliferation signals and a therapeutic target in many cancers. Here, we characterize two central quantitative aspects of this pathway: the mechanism by which signal strength is encoded and the response curve relating signal output to proliferation. Under steady-state conditions, we find that ERK is activated in discrete, asynchronous pulses with frequency and duration determined by extracellular concentrations of EGF spanning the physiological range. In genetically identical sister cells, cell-to-cell variability in pulse dynamics influences the decision to enter S phase. While targeted inhibition of EGFR reduces the frequency of ERK activity pulses, inhibition of MEK reduces their amplitude. Continuous response curves measured in multiple cell lines reveal that proliferation is effectively silenced only when ERK pathway output falls below a threshold of ∼10{\%}, indicating that high-dose targeting of the pathway is necessary to achieve therapeutic efficacy. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Here, we present Scribe (https://github.com/aristoteleo/Scribe-py), a toolkit for detecting and visualizing causal regulatory interactions between genes and explore the potential for single-cell experiments to power network reconstruction. Scribe employs restricted directed information to determine causality by estimating the strength of information transferred from a potential regulator to its downstream target. We apply Scribe and other leading approaches for causal network reconstruction to several types of single-cell measurements and show that there is a dramatic drop in performance for “pseudotime”-ordered single-cell data compared with true time-series data. We demonstrate that performing causal inference requires temporal coupling between measurements. We show that methods such as “RNA velocity” restore some degree of coupling through an analysis of chromaffin cell fate commitment. These analyses highlight a shortcoming in experimental and computational methods for analyzing gene regulation at single-cell resolution and suggest ways of overcoming it. Qiu et al. present Scribe (https://github.com/aristoteleo/Scribe-py), a toolkit for detecting and visualizing causal regulatory networks between genes in diverse single-cell datasets. They use Scribe to understand how causal network reconstruction depends on temporal coupling between measurements.

Characterization of transcriptional bursting, including the burst size and frequency, has mainly relied on live-cell4,6,8 or single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization3,5,8,9 recordings of selected loci. Here we determine transcriptome-wide burst frequencies and sizes for endogenous mouse and human genes using allele-sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing. We show that core promoter elements affect burst size and uncover synergistic effects between TATA and initiator elements, which were masked at mean expression levels. Notably, we provide transcriptome-wide evidence that enhancers control burst frequencies, and demonstrate that cell-type-specific gene expression is primarily shaped by changes in burst frequencies. Together, our data show that burst frequency is primarily encoded in enhancers and burst size in core promoters, and that allelic single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful model for investigating transcriptional kinetics.},

Moreover, a suitable methodology is presented to simultaneously monitor phototriggered morphological changes and the associated molecular pathways with spatiotemporal resolution employing time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy at the single cell level. The results showed that morphological changes can be complemented with a quantitative evaluation of the associated molecular signaling cascades for the unambiguous assignment of reactive oxygen species-related photoinduced apoptosis.

The TF-GPC two-photon excitation patterns generated large photocurrents in Channelrhodopsin-2-expressing cultured cells and neurons and in mouse acute cortical slices.

Currently, we have a good understanding of how fluctuations arise and propagate in small molecular circuits. Convincing experimental observations exist of fluctuations in the growth and fitness characteristics of single cells.

abstract = {Duration of heart rate corrected QT interval (QTc) is a crucial and critical factor in the assessment of repolarization changes considering safety of drugs and cardiac disorders. In rats, a validated approach to QT correction is lacking. In this study, we tested the normalization of QTc using normalization factor according to rat's cardiac cycle length (RR). Standard 12-lead ECG was measured in anesthetized rats at basal conditions and at various pharmacological conditions such as beta-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol or medication with clarithromycin (single- or repeated dosing for seven days), bisoprolol or ivabradine. For QT correction, standard Bazett's formula (QTc-B=QT/(RR)1/2) and Bazett's formula normalized to average rat RR (QTcn-B=QT/(RR/f)1/2, f=150ms) were compared. Duration of QT showed a positive correlation with RR duration (Pearson r=0.7645, P{\textless}0.001). Calculated QTc-B gave 2-2.5 fold of values of uncorrected QT, whereas values of normalized QTcn-B were in the physiological range. QTcn-B was unrelated to RR (Pearson r=0.1122, not significant) but the relationship between QTcn-B and QT remained preserved (Pearson r=0.7216, P{\textless}0.001). Both single and repeated administration of clarithromycin prolonged QT as compared to the controls but a significant dose-dependent difference between clarithromycin applications was revealed only when QTcn-B was used. Beta-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol prolonged, while beta-blockade with bisoprolol shortened QTcn-B. Ivabradine dose-dependently induced bradycardia without altering QT. However, QTcn-B showed false positive shortening at sustained bradycardia. Therefore, adjusted formula for QTcn-B is suitable for QT correction in rats but its use should be considered carefully in case of very low heart rate. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Here, we combine genome editing and multi-color live imaging to simultaneously visualize physical enhancer–promoter interaction and transcription at the single-cell level in Drosophila embryos. By examining transcriptional activation of a reporter by the endogenous even-skipped enhancers, which are located 150 kb away, we identify three distinct topological conformation states and measure their transition kinetics. We show that sustained proximity of the enhancer to its target is required for activation. Transcription in turn affects the three-dimensional topology as it enhances the temporal stability of the proximal conformation and is associated with further spatial compaction. Furthermore, the facilitated long-range activation results in transcriptional competition at the locus, causing corresponding developmental defects. Our approach offers quantitative insight into the spatial and temporal determinants of long-range gene regulation and their implications for cellular fates.},

abstract = {Numerous synthetic biology endeavors require well-tuned co-expression of functional components for success. Classically, monodirectional promoters (MDPs) have been used for such applications, but MDPs are limited in terms of multi-gene co-expression capabilities. Consequently, there is a pressing need for new tools with improved flexibility in terms of genetic circuit design, metabolic pathway assembly, and optimization. Here, motivated by nature's use of bidirectional promoters (BDPs) as a solution for efficient gene co-expression, we generate a library of 168 synthetic BDPs in the yeast Komagataella phaffii (syn. Pichia pastoris ), leveraging naturally occurring BDPs as a parts repository. This library of synthetic BDPs allows for rapid screening of diverse expression profiles and ratios to optimize gene co-expression, including for metabolic pathways (taxadiene, $\beta$-carotene). The modular design strategies applied for creating the BDP library could be relevant in other eukaryotic hosts, enabling a myriad of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology applications.},

These enzymes, once activated, dismantle the cell by selectively cleaving key proteins after aspartate residues. The events culminating in caspase activation are the subject of intense study because of their role in cancer, and neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders. Here we present a mechanistic mathematical model, formulated on the basis of newly emerging information, describing key elements of receptor-mediated and stress-induced caspase activation. We have used mass-conservation principles in conjunction with kinetic rate laws to formulate ordinary differential equations that describe the temporal evolution of caspase activation. Qualitative strategies for the prevention of caspase activation are simulated and compared with experimental data. We show that model predictions are consistent with available information. Thus, the model could aid in better understanding caspase activation and identifying therapeutic approaches promoting or retarding apoptotic cell death.},

@article{Ding2018,
abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, splicing affects the fate of each pre-mRNA transcript, helping to determine whether it is ultimately processed into an mRNA, or degraded. The efficiency of splicing plays a key role in gene expression. However, because it depends on the levels of multiple isoforms at the same transcriptional active site (TAS) in the same cell, splicing efficiency has been challenging to measure. Here, we introduce a quantitative single-molecule FISH-based method that enables determination of the absolute abundances of distinct RNA isoforms at individual TASs. Using this method, we discovered that splicing efficiency behaves in an unexpected "economy of scale" manner, increasing, rather than decreasing, with gene expression levels, opposite to a standard enzymatic process. This behavior could result from an observed correlation between splicing efficiency and spatial proximity to nuclear speckles. Economy of scale splicing represents a non-linear filter that amplifies the expression of genes when they are more strongly transcribed. This method will help to reveal the roles of splicing in the quantitative control of gene expression.},

This heterogeneity has complicated the search for ‘magic bullets'—individual genes or pathways that could be targeted and have beneficial effects for large numbers of patients. Instead, recent studies suggest that cancer can be more effectively analyzed through the use of systems biology techniques that examine multiple pathways and account for interactions between these pathways. In this review, we outline the various ways in which systems biology can be utilized to translate high-throughput data into a signaling network and then computationally analyze how cells make decisions based on the information flow through this network. We then discuss recent studies utilizing network-level analysis to reveal therapeutic targets, predict which tumors will be sensitive to existing drugs, and develop combinatorial therapies that target multiple pathways, demonstrating the potential for systems biology to revolutionize cancer therapy.},

abstract = {The reproducibility and precision of biological patterning is limited by the accuracy with which concentration profiles of morphogen molecules can be established and read out by their targets. We consider four measures of precision for the Bicoid morphogen in the Drosophila embryo: the concentration differences that distinguish neighboring cells, the limits set by the random arrival of Bicoid molecules at their targets (which depends on absolute concentration), the noise in readout of Bicoid by the activation of Hunchback, and the reproducibility of Bicoid concentration at corresponding positions in multiple embryos. We show, through a combination of different experiments, that all of these quantities are ∼10{\%}. This agreement among different measures of accuracy indicates that the embryo is not faced with noisy input signals and readout mechanisms; rather, the system exerts precise control over absolute concentrations and responds reliably to small concentration differences, approaching the limits set by basic physical principles. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We developed genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles (GEMs) to dissect these mechanisms. GEMs are homomultimeric scaffolds fused to a fluorescent protein that self-assemble into bright, stable particles of defined size and shape. By combining tracking of GEMs with genetic and pharmacological approaches, we discovered that the mTORC1 pathway can modulate the effective diffusion coefficient of particles ≥20 nm in diameter more than 2-fold by tuning ribosome concentration, without any discernable effect on the motion of molecules ≤5 nm. This change in ribosome concentration affected phase separation both in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results establish a role for mTORC1 in controlling both the mesoscale biophysical properties of the cytoplasm and biomolecular condensation. mTORC1 signaling controls phase transitions in the cytoplasm through its effects on molecular crowding.},

abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging is useful for applications ranging from medical diagnostics to crop monitoring; however, traditional scanning hyperspectral imagers are prohibitively slow and expensive for widespread adoption. Snapshot techniques exist but are often confined to bulky benchtop setups or have low spatio-spectral resolution. In this paper, we propose a novel, compact, and inexpensive computational camera for snapshot hyperspectral imaging. Our system consists of a repeated spectral filter array placed directly on the image sensor and a diffuser placed close to the sensor. Each point in the world maps to a unique pseudorandom pattern on the spectral filter array, which encodes multiplexed spatio-spectral information. A sparsity-constrained inverse problem solver then recovers the hyperspectral volume with good spatio-spectral resolution. By using a spectral filter array, our hyperspectral imaging framework is flexible and can be designed with contiguous or non-contiguous spectral filters that can be chosen for a given application. We provide theory for system design, demonstrate a prototype device, and present experimental results with high spatio-spectral resolution.},

We used number and brightness analysis, two-color cross number and brightness analysis, and Raster image correlation spectroscopy to obtain the number of molecules, aggregation state, and diffusion coefficient as a function of time and cell location. We observed that binding of Concanavalin A to the membrane and the formation of small aggregates paralleled cell morphology changes, indicating progressive cell compaction and death.

In the embryo, HSCs arise from a defined subset of arterial endothelial cells (ECs) located in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region that undergo endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT). Arterialization and HSC development are generally believed to require the action of Notch. Here we show that although Notch activity is initially required for arterialization, it is detrimental to subsequent EHT. Mechanistically, we show that effective EHT depends on a Mfng-induced decrease in Jag1-Notch signaling in hemogenic ECs. This causes upregulation of Mycn, an important metabolic and cell-cycle regulator that we found to be required for EHT. During the subsequent development of hematopoietic lineages, Mycn expression decreases and its function is taken on by the homologous Myc gene.},

abstract = {The stereotyped arrangement of sensory bristles on the adult fly thorax arises from a self-organized process, in which inhibitory Notch signaling both delimits proneural stripes and singles out sensory organ precursor cells (SOPs). A dynamic balance between proneural factors and Enhancer of split-HLH (E(spl)-HLH) Notch targets underlies patterning, but how this is regulated is unclear. Here, were identify two classes of E(spl)-HLH factors, whose expression both precedes and delimits proneural activity, and is dependent on proneural activity and required for proper SOP spacing within the stripes, respectively. These two classes are partially redundant, since a member of the second class, that is normally cross-repressed by members of the first class, can functionally compensate for their absence. The regulation of specific E(spl)-HLH genes by proneural factors amplifies the response to Notch as SOPs are being selected, contributing to patterning dynamics in the notum, and likely operates in other developmental contexts.},

abstract = {When exposed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a closely related death ligand and investigational therapeutic, cells enter a protracted period of variable duration in which only upstream initiator caspases are active. A subsequent and sudden transition marks activation of the downstream effector caspases that rapidly dismantle the cell. Thus, extrinsic apoptosis is controlled by an unusual variable-delay, snap-action switch that enforces an unambiguous choice between life and death. To understand how the extrinsic apoptosis switch functions in quantitative terms, we constructed a mathematical model based on a mass-action representation of known reaction pathways. The model was trained against experimental data obtained by live-cell imaging, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting of cells perturbed by protein depletion and overexpression. The trained model accurately reproduces the behavior of normal and perturbed cells exposed to TRAIL, making it possible to study switching mechanisms in detail. Model analysis shows, and experiments confirm, that the duration of the delay prior to effector caspase activation is determined by initiator caspase-8 activity and the rates of other reactions lying immediately downstream of the TRAIL receptor. Sudden activation of effector caspases is achieved downstream by reactions involved in permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and relocalization of proteins such as Smac. We find that the pattern of interactions among Bcl-2 family members, the partitioning of Smac from its binding partner XIAP, and the mechanics of pore assembly are all critical for snap-action control.

Here, we review the key morphogenetic steps during liver development, from the prehepatic endoderm stage to the postnatal period, and consider several model organisms while focussing on the mammalian liver. We first discuss how the liver buds out of the endoderm and gives rise to an asymmetric liver. We next outline the mechanisms driving liver and lobe growth, and review morphogenesis of the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts; morphogenetic responses of the biliary tract to liver injury are discussed. Finally, we describe the mechanisms driving formation of the vasculature, namely venous and arterial vessels, as well as sinusoids.},

abstract = {The GTPases Rac1, RhoA and Cdc42 act together to control cytoskeleton dynamics. Recent biosensor studies have shown that all three GTPases are activated at the front of migrating cells, and biochemical evidence suggests that they may regulate one another: Cdc42 can activate Rac1 (ref. 8), and Rac1 and RhoA are mutually inhibitory. However, their spatiotemporal coordination, at the seconds and single-micrometre dimensions typical of individual protrusion events, remains unknown. Here we examine GTPase coordination in mouse embryonic fibroblasts both through simultaneous visualization of two GTPase biosensors and using a 'computational multiplexing' approach capable of defining the relationships between multiple protein activities visualized in separate experiments. We found that RhoA is activated at the cell edge synchronous with edge advancement, whereas Cdc42 and Rac1 are activated 2 micro-m behind the edge with a delay of 40 s. This indicates that Rac1 and RhoA operate antagonistically through spatial separation and precise timing, and that RhoA has a role in the initial events of protrusion, whereas Rac1 and Cdc42 activate pathways implicated in reinforcement and stabilization of newly expanded protrusions.},

abstract = {The crypts of the intestinal epithelium house the stem cells that ensure the continual renewal of the epithelial cells that line the intestinal tract. Crypt number increases by a process called crypt fission, the division of a single crypt into two daughter crypts. Fission drives normal tissue growth and maintenance. Correspondingly, it becomes less frequent in adulthood. Importantly, fission is reactivated to drive adenoma growth. The mechanisms governing fission are poorly understood. However, only by knowing how normal fission operates can cancer-associated changes be elucidated. We studied normal fission in tissue in three dimensions using high-resolution imaging and used intestinal organoids to identify underlying mechanisms. We discovered that both the number and relative position of Paneth cells and Lgr5+ cells are important for fission. Furthermore, the higher stiffness and increased adhesion of Paneth cells are involved in determining the site of fission. Formation of a cluster of Lgr5+ cells between at least two Paneth-cell-rich domains establishes the site for the upward invagination that initiates fission.},

In an effort to encapsulate the breadth over which fluorescent biosensors have expanded, we endeavored to assemble a comprehensive list of published engineered biosensors, and we discuss many of the molecular designs utilized in their development. Then, we review how the high temporal and spatial resolution afforded by fluorescent biosensors has aided our understanding of the spatiotemporal regulation of signaling networks at the cellular and subcellular level. Finally, we highlight some emerging areas of research in both biosensor design and applications that are on the forefront of biosensor development.},

abstract = {When cells are exposed to death ligands such as TRAIL, a fraction undergoes apoptosis and a fraction survives; if surviving cells are re-exposed to TRAIL, fractional killing is once again observed. Therapeutic antibodies directed against TRAIL receptors also cause fractional killing, even at saturating concentrations, limiting their effectiveness. Fractional killing arises from cell-to-cell fluctuations in protein levels (extrinsic noise), but how this results in a clean bifurcation between life and death remains unclear. In this paper, we identify a threshold in the rate and timing of initiator caspase activation that distinguishes cells that live from those that die; by mapping this threshold, we can predict fractional killing of cells exposed to natural and synthetic agonists alone or in combination with sensitizing drugs such as bortezomib. A phenomenological model of the threshold also quantifies the contributions of two resistance genes (c-FLIP and Bcl-2), providing new insight into the control of cell fate by opposing pro-death and pro-survival proteins and suggesting new criteria for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic TRAIL receptor agonists.},

In this work we show how deep learning enables biological observations beyond the physical limitations of microscopes. On seven concrete examples we illustrate how microscopy images can be restored even if 60-fold fewer photons are used during acquisition, how isotropic resolution can be achieved even with a 10-fold under-sampling along the axial direction, and how diffraction-limited structures can be resolved at 20-times higher frame-rates compared to state-of-the-art methods.

In this article we illustrate some basic features of error bars and explain how they can help communicate data and assist correct interpretation. Error bars may show confidence intervals, standard errors, standard deviations, or other quantities. Different types of error bars give quite different information, and so figure legends must make clear what error bars represent. We suggest eight simple rules to assist with effective use and interpretation of error bars.},

abstract = {Imaging can be thought of as the most direct of experiments. You see something; you report what you see. If only things were truly this simple. Modern imaging technology has brought about a revolution in the kinds of questions we can approach, but this comes at the price of increasingly complex equipment. Moreover, in an attempt to market competing systems, the microscopes have often been inappropriately described as easy to use and suitable for near-beginners. Insufficient understanding of the experimental manipulations and equipment set-up leads to the introduction of errors during image acquisition. In this feature, I review some of the most common practical pitfalls faced by researchers during image acquisition, and how they can affect the interpretation of the experimental data. This article is targeted neither to the microscopy gurus who push forward the frontiers of imaging technology nor to my imaging specialist colleagues who may wince at the overly simplistic comments and lack of detail. Instead, this is for beginners who gulp with alarm when they hear the word "confocal pinhole" or sigh as they watch their cells fade and die in front of their very eyes time and time again at the microscope. Take heart, beginners, if microscopes were actually so simple then many people (including myself) would suddenly be out of a job!},

abstract = {beta-Catenin (beta-cat) is a key signaling component of the canonical Wnt pathway as well as an increasingly studied contributor to various pathways that regulate cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. For its best known function, posttranslational stabilization of beta-cat is required for T cell factor-dependent transcription of numerous downstream targets of Wnt, and this process is aberrantly active in a wide array of cancers. To enable direct monitoring of posttranslational stabilization of beta-cat in cells and living animals, we constructed and characterized the bioluminescent fusion reporters beta-cat firefly luciferase (beta-cat-FLuc) and beta-cat click beetle green luciferase (beta-cat-CBG). These reporters provided real-time, noninvasive readout of modulators of beta-cat stability in cellulo and, furthermore, enabled monitoring of changes in total beta-cat levels in vivo in intact animals. In addition, using spectral unmixing, green beta-cat-CBG was deconvoluted from a red TCF-dependent FLuc reporter (TOPFLASH), enabling analysis of beta-cat processing and downstream transcriptional activation simultaneously. By using this system, the natural product epigallocatechin 3-gallate was found to block Wnt signaling, independent of beta-cat processing. These beta-cat reporters represent a powerful new strategy for identifying in cellulo and in vivo dynamic regulators and mechanism-based therapeutics of signaling pathways mediated by beta-cat stabilization.},

abstract = {High-throughput technologies, offering an unprecedented wealth of quantitative data underlying the makeup of living systems, are changing biology. Notably, the systematic mapping of the relationships between biochemical entities has fueled the rapid development of network biology, offering a suitable framework to describe disease phenotypes and predict potential drug targets. However, our ability to develop accurate dynamical models remains limited, due in part to the limited knowledge of the kinetic parameters underlying these interactions. Here, we explore the degree to which we can make reasonably accurate predictions in the absence of the kinetic parameters. We find that simple dynamically agnostic models are sufficient to recover the strength and sign of the biochemical perturbation patterns observed in 87 biological models for which the underlying kinetics are known. Surprisingly, a simple distance-based model achieves 65{\%} accuracy. We show that this predictive power is robust to topological and kinetic parameter perturbations, and we identify key network properties that can increase up to 80{\%} the recovery rate of the true perturbation patterns. We validate our approach using experimental data on the chemotactic pathway in bacteria, finding that a network model of perturbation spreading predicts with ∼80{\%} accuracy the directionality of gene expression and phenotype changes in knock-out and overproduction experiments. These findings show that the steady advances in mapping out the topology of biochemical interaction networks opens avenues for accurate perturbation spread modeling, with direct implications for medicine and drug development.},

@article{Spencer2009,
abstract = {In microorganisms, noise in gene expression gives rise to cell-to-cell variability in protein concentrations. In mammalian cells, protein levels also vary and individual cells differ widely in their responsiveness to uniform physiological stimuli. In the case of apoptosis mediated by TRAIL (tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) it is common for some cells in a clonal population to die while others survive-a striking divergence in cell fate. Among cells that die, the time between TRAIL exposure and caspase activation is highly variable. Here we image sister cells expressing reporters of caspase activation and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization after exposure to TRAIL. We show that naturally occurring differences in the levels or states of proteins regulating receptor-mediated apoptosis are the primary causes of cell-to-cell variability in the timing and probability of death in human cell lines. Protein state is transmitted from mother to daughter, giving rise to transient heritability in fate, but protein synthesis promotes rapid divergence so that sister cells soon become no more similar to each other than pairs of cells chosen at random. Our results have implications for understanding 'fractional killing' of tumour cells after exposure to chemotherapy, and for variability in mammalian signal transduction in general.},

abstract = {Fas-induced apoptosis is a critical process for normal immune system development and function. Although many molecular components in the Fas signaling pathway have been identified, a systematic understanding of how they work together to determine network dynamics and apoptosis itself has remained elusive. To address this, we generated a computational model for interpreting and predicting effects of pathway component properties. The model integrates current information concerning the signaling network downstream of Fas activation, through both type I and type II pathways, until activation of caspase-3. Unknown parameter values in the model were estimated using experimental data obtained from human Jurkat T cells. To elucidate critical signaling network properties, we examined the effects of altering the level of Bcl-2 on the kinetics of caspase-3 activation, using both overexpression and knockdown in the model and experimentally. Overexpression was used to distinguish among alternative hypotheses for inhibitory binding interactions of Bcl-2 with various components in the mitochondrial pathway. In comparing model simulations with experimental results, we find the best agreement when Bcl-2 blocks the release of cytochrome c by binding to both Bax and truncated Bid instead of Bax, truncated Bid, or Bid alone. Moreover, although Bcl-2 overexpression strongly reduces caspase-3 activation, Bcl-2 knockdown has a negligible effect, demonstrating a general model finding that varying the expression levels of signal molecules frequently has asymmetric effects on the outcome. Finally, we demonstrate that the relative dominance of type I vs type II pathways can be switched by varying particular signaling component levels without changing network structure.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Typical operationalizations of Granger causality make a strong assumption that every time point of the effect time series is influenced by a combination of other time series with a fixed time delay. However, the assumption of the fixed time delay does not hold in many applications, such as collective behavior, financial markets, and many natural phenomena. To address this issue, we develop variable-lag Granger causality, a generalization of Granger causality that relaxes the assumption of the fixed time delay and allows causes to influence effects with arbitrary time delays. In addition, we propose a method for inferring variable-lag Granger causality relations. We demonstrate our approach on an application for studying coordinated collective behavior and show that it performs better than several existing methods in both simulated and real-world datasets. Our approach can be applied in any domain of time series analysis.},

abstract = {It is well known that arteries grow and remodel in response to mechanical stimuli. Vascular smooth muscle cells are the main mediators of this process, as they can switch phenotype from contractile to synthetic, and vice-versa, based on the surrounding bio-chemo-mechanical stimuli. A correct regulation of this phenotypic switch is fundamental to obtain and maintain arterial homeostasis. Notch, a mechanosensitive signaling pathway, is one of the main regulators of the vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype. Therefore, understanding Notch dynamics is key to elucidate arterial growth, remodeling, and mechanobiology. We have recently developed a one-dimensional agent-based model to investigate Notch signaling in arteries. However, due to its one-dimensional formulation, the model cannot be adopted to study complex nonsymmetrical geometries and, importantly, it cannot capture the realistic “cell connectivity” in arteries, here defined as the number of cell neighbors. Notch functions via direct cell-cell contact; thus, the number of cell neighbors could be an essential feature of Notch dynamics. Here, we extended the agent-based model to a two-dimensional formulation, to investigate the effects of cell connectivity on Notch dynamics and cell phenotypes in arteries. The computational results, supported by a sensitivity analysis, indicate that cell connectivity has marginal effects when Notch dynamics is dominated by the process of lateral induction, which induces all cells to have a uniform phenotype. When lateral induction is weaker, cells exhibit a nonuniform phenotype distribution and the percentage of synthetic cells within an artery depends on the number of neighbors.},

abstract = {Individual cells within a population undergo apoptosis at distinct, apparently random time points. By analyzing cellular mitotic history, we identified that sibling HeLa cell pairs, in contrast to random cell pairs, underwent apoptosis synchronously. This allowed us to use high-speed cellular imaging to investigate mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), a highly coordinated, rapid process during apoptosis, at a temporal resolution approximately 100 times higher than possible previously. We obtained new functional and mechanistic insight into the process of MOMP: We were able to determine the kinetics of pore formation in the outer mitochondrial membrane from the initiation phase of cytochrome-c-GFP redistribution, and showed differential pore formation kinetics in response to intrinsic or extrinsic apoptotic stimuli (staurosporine, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)). We also detected that the onset of mitochondrial permeabilization frequently proceeded as a wave through the cytosol, and that the frequency of wave occurrence in response to TRAIL was reduced by inhibition of protein kinase CK2. Computational analysis by a partial differential equation model suggested that the spread of permeabilization signals could sufficiently be explained by diffusion-adsorption velocities of locally generated permeabilization inducers. Taken together, our study yielded the first comprehensive analysis of clonal cell-to-cell variability in apoptosis execution and allowed to visualize and explain the dynamics of MOMP in cells undergoing apoptosis.},

abstract = {Computational modelling has become increasingly common in life science research. To provide a platform to support universal sharing, easy accessibility and model reproducibility, BioModels (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/), a repository for mathematical models, was established in 2005. The current BioModels platform allows submission of models encoded in diverse modelling formats, including SBML, CellML, PharmML, COMBINE archive, MATLAB, Mathematica, R, Python or C++. The models submitted to BioModels are curated to verify the computational representation of the biological process and the reproducibility of the simulation results in the reference publication. The curation also involves encoding models in standard formats and annotation with controlled vocabularies following MIRIAM (minimal information required in the annotation of biochemical models) guidelines. BioModels now accepts large-scale submission of auto-generated computational models. With gradual growth in content over 15 years, BioModels currently hosts about 2000 models from the published literature. With about 800 curated models, BioModels has become the world's largest repository of curated models and emerged as the third most used data resource after PubMed and Google Scholar among the scientists who use modelling in their research. Thus, BioModels benefits modellers by providing access to reliable and semantically enriched curated models in standard formats that are easy to share, reproduce and reuse.},

While confocal and two-photon microscopy have revolutionized biomedical research, current implementations are costly, complex and limited in their ability to image 3D volumes at high speeds. Light-sheet microscopy techniques using two-objective, orthogonal illumination and detection require a highly constrained sample geometry, and either physical sample translation or complex synchronization of illumination and detection planes. In contrast, SCAPE microscopy acquires images using an angled, swept light-sheet in a single-objective, en-face geometry. Unique confocal descanning and image rotation optics map this moving plane onto a stationary high-speed camera, permitting completely translationless 3D imaging of intact samples at rates exceeding 20 volumes per second. We demonstrate SCAPE microscopy by imaging spontaneous neuronal firing in the intact brain of awake behaving mice, as well as freely moving transgenic Drosophila larvae.},

Over the last decade, many new technologies and techniques have been developed which allow for deeper, faster, or higher resolution imaging. For the non-expert microscopist, it can be difficult to match the best imaging technique to the biological question to be examined. Picking the right technique requires a basic understanding of the underlying imaging physics for each technique, as well as an informed comparison and balancing of competing imaging properties in the context of the sample to be imaged. This unit provides concise descriptions of a range of commercially available imaging techniques and provides a tabular guide to choosing among them.

Fluorescent protein-based biosensors have enabled the real-time monitoring of dynamic signalling processes within the native context of living cells, yet most commonly used biosensors exhibit poor sensitivity (for example, due to low dynamic range) and are limited to imaging signalling activities in isolation. Here, we address this challenge by developing a suite of excitation ratiometric kinase activity biosensors that offer the highest reported dynamic range and enable the detection of subtle changes in signalling activity that could not be reliably detected previously, as well as a suite of single-fluorophore biosensors that enable the simultaneous tracking of as many as six distinct signalling activities in single living cells.},

abstract = {Fluorescently labeled myosin heads (S1) were added to muscle fibers and myofibrils at various concentrations. The orientation of the absorption dipole of the dye with respect to the axis of F-actin was calculated from polarization of fluorescence which was measured by a novel method from video images of muscle. In this method light emitted from muscle was split by a birefringent crystal into two nonoverlapping images: the first image was created with light polarized in the direction parallel to muscle axis, and the second image was created with light polarized in the direction perpendicular to muscle axis. Images were recorded by high-sensitivity video camera and polarization was calculated from the relative intensity of both images. The method allows measurement of the fluorescence polarization from single myofibril irrigated with low concentrations of S1 labeled with dye. Orientation was also measured by fluorescence-detected linear dichroism. The orientation was different when muscle was irrigated with high concentration of S1 (molar ratio S1:actin in the I bands equal to 1) then when it was irrigated with low concentration of S1 (molar ratio S1:actin in the I bands equal to 0.32). The results support our earlier proposal that S1 could form two different rigor complexes with F-actin depending on the molar ratio of S1:actin.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). High-throughput quantitative phase imaging (QPI) is essential to cellular phenotypes characterization as it allows high-content cell analysis and avoids adverse effects of staining reagents on cellular viability and cell signaling. Among different approaches, Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) is probably the most promising technique to realize high-throughput QPI by synthesizing a wide-field, high-resolution complex image from multiple angle-variably illuminated, low-resolution images. However, the large dataset requirement in conventional FPM significantly limits its imaging speed, resulting in low temporal throughput. Moreover, the underlying theoretical mechanism as well as optimum illumination scheme for high-accuracy phase imaging in FPM remains unclear. Herein, we report a high-speed FPM technique based on programmable annular illuminations (AIFPM). The optical-transfer-function (OTF) analysis of FPM reveals that the low-frequency phase information can only be correctly recovered if the LEDs are precisely located at the edge of the objective numerical aperture (NA) in the frequency space. By using only 4 low-resolution images corresponding to 4 tilted illuminations matching a 10×, 0.4 NA objective, we present the high-speed imaging results of in vitro Hela cells mitosis and apoptosis at a frame rate of 25 Hz with a full-pitch resolution of 655 nm at a wavelength of 525 nm (effective NA = 0.8) across a wide field-of-view (FOV) of 1.77 mm2, corresponding to a space-bandwidth-time product of 411 megapixels per second. Our work reveals an important capability of FPM towards high-speed high-throughput imaging of in vitro live cells, achieving video-rate QPI performance across a wide range of scales, both spatial and temporal.},

@article{Zhivotovsky1999,
abstract = {The activation of the caspase family of proteases has been detected in numerous cell systems and appears to function as a common pathway through which apoptotic mechanisms may operate. Caspases are synthesized as precursors (pro-caspases) and are converted into mature enzymes by apoptotic signals. The effects of caspases in apoptosis are accomplished by the cleavage of numerous proteins located in different intracellular compartments. In the present study we have addressed the question of the subcellular localization of different pro- and active caspases as well as several other proteins, such as Apaf-1, calpain and DFF, which also play important roles in the apoptotic process. We found that at least three pro-caspases (pro-caspases-2, -3 and -9) were present in both the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions of untreated Jurkat T lymphocytes. Only pro-caspase-2 was found in the nuclear fraction. Pro-caspases-7 and -8 were found only in the cytosolic fraction. In apoptotic cells, caspases-3, -8 and -9 were present in the cytosolic fraction, whereas caspases-3 and -9 were also found in the mitochondrial fraction and caspase-7 in the microsomal fraction. Caspases-2 and -3 were present in the nuclear fraction. The selective localization of pro-caspases in different subcellular compartments may play an important, but yet unknown, role in their activation. The translocation of active caspases to other subcellular compartments appears to be critical for the development of the apoptotic process.},

abstract = {Extensive apoptosis is often seen in patterning mutants, suggesting that tissues can detect and eliminate potentially harmful mis-specified cells. Here, we show that the pattern of apoptosis in the embryonic epidermis of Drosophila is not a response to fate mis-specification but can instead be explained by the limiting availability of prosurvival signaling molecules released from locations determined by patterning information. In wild-type embryos, the segmentation cascade elicits the segmental production of several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands, including the transforming growth factor Spitz (TGF$\alpha$), and the neuregulin, Vein. This leads to an undulating pattern of signaling activity, which prevents expression of the proapoptotic gene head involution defective (hid) throughout the epidermis. In segmentation mutants, where specific peaks of EGFR ligands fail to form, gaps in signaling activity appear, leading to coincident hid up-regulation and subsequent cell death. These data provide a mechanistic understanding of how cell survival, and thus appropriate tissue size, is made contingent on correct patterning.},

Originally, PCD was almost synonymous with apoptosis; recently, however, alternative mechanisms of PCD have been reported. Here, we provide an overview of several distinct PCD mechanisms, namely apoptosis, autophagy and necroptosis. In addition, we discuss the complex signals that emanate from dying cells, which can either trigger regeneration or instruct additional killing. Further advances in understanding the physiological roles of the various mechanisms of cell death and their associated signals will be important to selectively manipulate PCD for therapeutic purposes.},

Additionally, a large number of caspases have been identified in various animals from sponges to vertebrates. Caspases are thought to play a pivotal role in apoptosis as an evolutionarily conserved function; however, the number of caspases that can be identified is distinct for each species. This indicates that species-specific functions or diversification of physiological roles has been cultivated through caspase evolution. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that caspases are also involved in inflammation and cellular differentiation in mammals. This review highlights vertebrate caspases in their universal and divergent functions and provides insight into the physiological roles of these molecules in animals.},

We tested this possibility in cell-free Xenopus laevis egg extracts and observed apoptotic trigger waves with speeds of {\~{}}30 micrometers per minute. Fractionation and inhibitor studies implicated multiple feedback loops in generating the waves. Apoptotic oocytes and eggs exhibited surface waves with speeds of {\~{}}30 micrometers per minute, which were tightly correlated with caspase activation. Thus, apoptosis spreads through trigger waves in both extracts and intact cells. Our findings show how apoptosis can spread over large distances within a cell and emphasize the general importance of trigger waves in cell signaling.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies indicate local caspase activation in dendrites or axons during development and in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emerging evidences point to soluble oligomeric amyloid-$\beta$ peptide as a causative agent in AD.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we describe the design of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based caspase sensors, fused to the microtubule associated protein tau. Specific caspase sensors preferentially cleaved by caspase-3, -6 or -9 were expressed in differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. The anchoring of the sensors resulted in high FRET signals both in extended neurites and soma and made analysis of spatiotemporal signal propagation possible. Caspase activation was detected as loss of FRET after exposure to different stimuli. Interestingly, after staurosporine treatment caspase-6 activation was significantly delayed in neurites compared to cell bodies. In addition, we show that exposure to oligomer-enriched amyloid-$\beta$ peptide resulted in loss of FRET in cells expressing sensors for caspase-3 and -6, but not -9, in both soma and neurites before neurite degeneration was observed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results show that by using anchored FRET sensors it is possible to detect stimuli-dependent differential activation of caspases and to distinguish local from global caspase activation in live neuronal cells. Furthermore, in these cells oligomer-enriched amyloid-$\beta$ peptide induces a global, rather than local activation of caspase-3 and -6, which subsequently leads to neuronal cell death.},

abstract = {Ligand-mediated dimerization has emerged as a universal mechanism of growth factor receptor activation. Neurotrophins interact with dimers of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), but the mechanism of receptor activation has remained elusive. Here, we show that p75NTR forms disulphide-linked dimers independently of neurotrophin binding through the highly conserved Cys257 in its transmembrane domain. Mutation of Cys257 abolished neurotrophin-dependent receptor activity but did not affect downstream signaling by the p75NTR/NgR/Lingo-1 complex in response to MAG, indicating the existence of distinct, ligand-specific activation mechanisms for p75NTR. FRET experiments revealed a close association of p75NTR intracellular domains that was transiently disrupted by conformational changes induced upon NGF binding. Although mutation of Cys257 did not alter the oligomeric state of p75NTR, the mutant receptor was no longer able to propagate conformational changes to the cytoplasmic domain upon ligand binding. We propose that neurotrophins activate p75NTR by a mechanism involving rearrangement of disulphide-linked receptor subunits. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The mechanism of optogenetic Bax-mediated apoptosis was explored using a series of small molecules known to interfere with various steps in programmed cell death. Optogenetic Bax appears to form a mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel analogous to that of endogenous Bax.},

Many different factors, both within and outside of the apoptosis signaling networks, have been correlated with the variable responses to various death-inducing treatments. Systems biology models offer us the opportunity to take a more synoptic view of the cell death process to identify multifactorial determinants of the cell death decision. Finally, with an eye toward 'systems pharmacology', we discuss how leveraging this new understanding should help us develop combination treatment strategies to compel cancer cells toward apoptosis by manipulating either the biochemical state of cancer cells or the dynamics of signal transduction.},

abstract = {The activity of proteins is typically regulated by secondary modifications and by interactions with other partners, resulting in the formation of protein complexes whose functions depend on the participating proteins. Accordingly, it is of central importance to monitor the presence of interaction complexes as well as their localization, thus providing information about the types of cells where the proteins are located and in what sub-cellular compartment these interactions occur. Several methods for visualizing protein interactions in situ have been developed during the last decade. These methods in most cases involve genetic constructs, and they have been successfully used in assays of living cell maintained in tissue culture, but they cannot easily be implemented in studies of clinical specimens. For such samples, affinity reagents like antibodies can be used to target the interacting proteins. In this review we will describe the in situ proximity ligation assays (in situ PLA), a method that is suitable for visualizing protein interactions in both tissue sections and in vitro cell lines, and we discuss research tasks when this or other method may be selected. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Here we address the issue of the sensitivity of the networks to variations in their biochemical parameters. We propose a mechanism for robust adaptation in simple signal transduction networks. We show that this mechanism applies in particular to bacterial chemotaxis. This is demonstrated within a quantitative model which explains, in a unified way, many aspects of chemotaxis, including proper responses to chemical gradients. The adaptation property is a consequence of the network's connectivity and does not require the 'fine-tuning' of parameters. We argue that the key properties of biochemical networks should be robust in order to ensure their proper functioning.},

abstract = {During gastrulation, physical forces reshape the simple embryonic tissue to form a complex body plan of multicellular organisms. These forces often cause large-scale asymmetric movements of the embryonic tissue. In many embryos, the tissue undergoing gastrulation movements is surrounded by a rigid protective shell. While it is well recognized that gastrulation movements depend on forces generated by tissue-intrinsic contractility, it is not known if interactions between the tissue and the protective shell provide additional forces that impact gastrulation. Here we show that a particular part of the blastoderm tissue of the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum tightly adheres in a temporally coordinated manner to the vitelline envelope surrounding the embryo. This attachment generates an additional force that counteracts the tissue-intrinsic contractile forces to create asymmetric tissue movements. Furthermore, this localized attachment is mediated by a specific integrin, and its knock-down leads to a gastrulation phenotype consistent with complete loss of attachment. Moreover, analysis of another integrin in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster suggests that gastrulation in this organism also relies on adhesion between the blastoderm and the vitelline. Together, our findings reveal a conserved mechanism whereby the spatiotemporal pattern of tissue adhesion to the vitelline envelope provides controllable counter-forces that shape gastrulation movements in insects.},

abstract = {Macromolecular crowding has a profound impact on reaction rates and the physical properties of the cell interior, but the mechanisms that regulate crowding are poorly understood. We developed genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles (GEMs) to dissect these mechanisms. GEMs are homomultimeric scaffolds fused to a fluorescent protein that self-assemble into bright, stable particles of defined size and shape. By combining tracking of GEMs with genetic and pharmacological approaches, we discovered that the mTORC1 pathway can modulate the effective diffusion coefficient of particles ≥20 nm in diameter more than 2-fold by tuning ribosome concentration, without any discernable effect on the motion of molecules ≤5 nm. This change in ribosome concentration affected phase separation both in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results establish a role for mTORC1 in controlling both the mesoscale biophysical properties of the cytoplasm and biomolecular condensation. mTORC1 signaling controls phase transitions in the cytoplasm through its effects on molecular crowding.},

abstract = {Signal transduction networks are complex, as are their mathematical models. Gaining a deeper understanding requires a system analysis. Important aspects are the number, location and stability of steady states. In particular, bistability has been recognised as an important feature to achieve molecular switching. This paper compares different model structures and analysis methods particularly useful for bistability analysis. The biological applications include proteolytic cascades as, for example, encountered in the apoptotic signalling pathway or in the blood clotting system. We compare three model structures containing zero-order, inhibitor and cooperative ultrasensitive reactions, all known to achieve bistability. The combination of phase plane and bifurcation analysis provides an illustrative and comprehensive understanding of how bistability can be achieved and indicates how robust this behaviour is. Experimentally, some so-called "inactive" components were shown to have a residual activity. This has been mostly ignored in mathematical models. Our analysis reveals that bistability is only mildly affected in the case of zero-order or inhibitor ultrasensitivity. However, the case where bistability is achieved by cooperative ultrasensitivity is severely affected by this perturbation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Unravelling the dynamic molecular interplay behind complex physiological processes such as neuronal plasticity requires the ability to both detect minute changes in biochemical states in response to physiological signals and track multiple signalling activities simultaneously. Fluorescent protein-based biosensors have enabled the real-time monitoring of dynamic signalling processes within the native context of living cells, yet most commonly used biosensors exhibit poor sensitivity (for example, due to low dynamic range) and are limited to imaging signalling activities in isolation. Here, we address this challenge by developing a suite of excitation ratiometric kinase activity biosensors that offer the highest reported dynamic range and enable the detection of subtle changes in signalling activity that could not be reliably detected previously, as well as a suite of single-fluorophore biosensors that enable the simultaneous tracking of as many as six distinct signalling activities in single living cells.},

Here we demonstrate that a neural network can learn to perform phase recovery and holographic image reconstruction after appropriate training. This deep learning-based approach provides an entirely new framework to conduct holographic imaging by rapidly eliminating twin-image and self-interference related spatial artifacts. Compared to existing approaches, this neural network based method is significantly faster to compute, and reconstructs improved phase and amplitude images of the objects using only one hologram, i.e., requires less number of measurements in addition to being computationally faster. We validated this method by reconstructing phase and amplitude images of various samples, including blood and Pap smears, and tissue sections. These results are broadly applicable to any phase recovery problem, and highlight that through machine learning challenging problems in imaging science can be overcome, providing new avenues to design powerful computational imaging systems.},

@article{Zolmajd-Haghighi2014,
abstract = {The behavior of fluorescence anisotropy and polarization in systems with multiple dyes is well known. Homo-FRET and its consequent energy migration cause the fluorescence anisotropy to decrease as the number of like fluorophores within energy transfer distance increases. This behavior is well understood when all subunits within a cluster are saturated with fluorophores. However, incomplete labeling as might occur from a mixture of endogenous and labeled monomer units, incomplete saturation of binding sites, or photobleaching produces stochastic mixtures. Models in widespread and longstanding use that describe these mixtures apply an assumption of equal fluorescence efficiency for all sites first stated by Weber and Daniel in 1966. The assumption states that fluorophores have the same brightness when free in solution as they do in close proximity to each other in a cluster. The assumption simplifies descriptions of anisotropy trends as the fractional labeling of the cluster changes. However, fluorophores in close proximity often exhibit nonadditivity due to such things as self-quenching behavior or exciplex formation. Therefore, the anisotropy of stochastic mixtures of fluorophore clusters of a particular size will depend on the behavior of those fluorophores in clusters. We present analytical expressions for fractionally labeled clusters exhibiting a range of behaviors, and experimental results from two systems: an assembled tetrameric cluster of fluorescent proteins and stochastically labeled bovine serum albumin containing up to 24 fluorophores. The experimental results indicate that clustered species do not follow the assumption of equal fluorescence efficiency in the systems studied with clustered fluorophores showing reduced fluorescence intensity. Application of the assumption of equal fluorescence efficiency will underpredict anisotropy and consequently underestimate cluster size in these two cases. The theoretical results indicate that careful selection of the fractional labeling in strongly quenched systems will enhance opportunities to determine cluster sizes, making accessible larger clusters than are currently considered possible. ?? 2014 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The biophysical investigation of living cells is currently possible by single molecular detection methods such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). FCS is applied for measuring the dynamic mobility of target molecules in living cells; however;the conventional FCS systems still lack quantitative analysis for many regions of interests (ROI) in real time. To improve this situation, we have developed a novel multipoint FCS system (M-FCS) that can measure multipoint correlation functions in the cell simultaneously. To evaluate its performance, we measured correlation functions for rhodamine 6G (Rh6G) in homogeneous conditions and for green fluorescence protein (GFP) in HeLa cells. We conclude that M-FCS possesses reliable performance. As a pharmacological application, glucocorticoid receptor protein fused GFP (GR-GFP) was transfected in HeLa cells and FCS measurements were carried out in the cytoplasm and the nucleus simultaneously. The translocation of GR-GFP from the cytoplasm to the nucleus by ligand stimulation was observed with laser scanning microscopy (LSM) and M-FCS. Particularly in the nucleus, the slower diffusion of GR-GFP suggested molecular interactions after the translocation. These data imply that M-FCS can be applied for quantitative analysis of kinetic processes in living cells.},

By using the same low magnification objective lenses as the objective and the tube lens, the EmSight is configured as a 1:1 imaging system that, providing large field-of-view (FOV) imaging onto a low-cost CMOS imaging sensor. The EmSight improves the image resolution by capturing a series of images of the sample at varying illumination angles; the instrument reconstructs a higher-resolution image by using the iterative Fourier ptychographic algorithm. In addition to providing high-resolution brightfield and phase imaging, the EmSight is also capable of fluorescence imaging at the native resolution of the objectives. We characterized the system using a phase Siemens star target, and show four-fold improved coherent resolution (synthetic NA of 0.42) and a depth of field of 0.2 mm. To conduct live, long-term dopaminergic neuron imaging, we cultured ventral midbrain from mice driving eGFP from the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter.

Unique confocal descanning and image rotation optics map this moving plane onto a stationary high-speed camera, permitting completely translationless 3D imaging of intact samples at rates exceeding 20 volumes per second.

abstract = {Scientific theories seek to provide simple explanations for significant empirical regularities based on fundamental physical and mechanistic constraints. Biological theories have rarely reached a level of generality and predictive power comparable to physical theories. This discrepancy is explained through a combination of frozen accidents, environmental heterogeneity, and widespread non-linearities observed in adaptive processes. At the same time, model building has proven to be very successful when it comes to explaining and predicting the behavior of particular biological systems. In this respect biology resembles alternative model-rich frameworks, such as economics and engineering. In this paper we explore the prospects for general theories in biology, and suggest that these take inspiration not only from physics, but also from the information sciences. Future theoretical biology is likely to represent a hybrid of parsimonious reasoning and algorithmic or rule-based explanation. An open question is whether these new frameworks will remain transparent to human reason. In this context, we discuss the role of machine learning in the early stages of scientific discovery. We argue that evolutionary history is not only a source of uncertainty, but also provides the basis, through conserved traits, for very general explanations for biological regularities, and the prospect of unified theories of life. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

This combination is very sensitive, allowing detection and measurement of fewer than 350 fluorescent protein molecules per living yeast cell.

@article{Digman2008,
abstract = {We describe a technique based on moment-analysis for the measurement of the average number of molecules and brightness in each pixel in fluorescence microscopy images. The average brightness of the particle is obtained from the ratio of the variance to the average intensity at each pixel. To obtain the average number of fluctuating particles, we divide the average intensity at one pixel by the brightness. This analysis can be used in a wide range of concentrations. In cells, the intensity at any given pixel may be due to bright immobile structures, dim fast diffusing particles, and to autofluorescence or scattering. The total variance is given by the variance of each of the above components in addition to the variance due to detector noise. Assuming that all sources of variance are independent, the total variance is the sum of the variances of the individual components. The variance due to the particles fluctuating in the observation volume is proportional to the square of the particle brightness while the variance of the immobile fraction, the autofluorescence, scattering, and that of the detector is proportional to the intensity of these components. Only the fluctuations that depend on the square of the brightness (the mobile particles) will have a ratio of the variance to the intensity {\textgreater}1. Furthermore, changing the fluorescence intensity by increasing the illumination power, distinguishes between these possible contributions. We show maps of molecular brightness and number of cell migration proteins obtained using a two-photon scanning microscope operating with a photon-counting detector. These brightness maps reveal binding dynamics at the focal adhesions with pixel resolution and provide a picture of the binding and unbinding process in which dim molecules attach to the adhesions or large molecular aggregates dissociate from adhesion. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {A Fourier transform analysis of 2.5 million spectra in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey was carried out to detect periodic spectral modulations. Signals having the same period were found in only 234 stars overwhelmingly in the F2 to K1 spectral range. The signals cannot be caused by instrumental or data analysis effects because they are present in only a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral range and because signal to noise ratio considerations predict that the signal should mostly be detected in the brightest objects, while this is not the case. We consider several possibilities, such as rotational transitions in molecules, rapid pulsations, Fourier transform of spectral lines and signals generated by Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI). They cannot be generated by molecules or rapid pulsations. It is highly unlikely that they come from the Fourier transform of spectral lines because too many strong lines located at nearly periodic frequencies are needed. Finally we consider the possibility, predicted in a previous published paper, that the signals are caused by light pulses generated by Extraterrestrial Intelligence to makes us aware of their existence. We find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an ETI signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis. The fact that they are only found in a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral range centered near the spectral type of the sun is also in agreement with the ETI hypothesis. However, at this stage, this hypothesis needs to be confirmed with further work. Although unlikely, there is also a possibility that the signals are due to highly peculiar chemical compositions in a small fraction of galactic halo stars.},

@article{Kroemer2007,
abstract = {Irrespective of the morphological features of end-stage cell death (that may be apoptotic, necrotic, autophagic, or mitotic), mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP) is frequently the decisive event that delimits the frontier between survival and death. Thus mitochondrial membranes constitute the battleground on which opposing signals combat to seal the cell's fate. Local players that determine the propensity to MMP include the pro- and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, proteins from the mitochondrialpermeability transition pore complex, as well as a plethora of interacting partners including mitochondrial lipids. Intermediate metabolites, redox processes, sphingolipids, ion gradients, transcription factors, as well as kinases and phosphatases link lethal and vital signals emanating from distinct subcellular compartments to mitochondria. Thus mitochondria integrate a variety of proapoptotic signals. Once MMP has been induced, it causes the release of catabolic hydrolases and activators of such enzymes (including those of caspases) from mitochondria. These catabolic enzymes as well as the cessation of the bioenergetic and redox functions of mitochondria finally lead to cell death, meaning that mitochondria coordinate the late stage of cellular demise. Pathological cell death induced by ischemia/reperfusion, intoxication with xenobiotics, neurodegenerative diseases, or viral infection also relies on MMP as a critical event. The inhibition of MMP constitutes an important strategy for the pharmaceutical prevention of unwarranted cell death. Conversely, induction of MMP in tumor cells constitutes the goal of anticancer chemotherapy.},

abstract = {Life relies on phenomena that range from changes in molecules that occur within nanoseconds to changes in populations that occur over millions of years. Researchers have developed a vast range of experimental techniques to analyze living systems, but a given technique usually only works over a limited range of length or time scales. Therefore, gaining a full understanding of a living system usually requires the integration of information obtained at multiple different scales by two or more techniques. This approach has undoubtedly led to a much better understanding of living systems but, equally, the staggering complexity of these systems, the sophistication and limitations of the techniques available in modern biology, and the need to use two or more techniques, can lead to persistent illusions of knowledge. Here, in an effort to make better use of the experimental techniques we have at our disposal, I propose a broad classification of techniques into six complementary approaches: perturbation, visualization, substitution, characterization, reconstitution, and simulation. Such a taxonomy might also help increase the reproducibility of inferences and improve peer review.},

abstract = {Breaking symmetry in populations of uniform cells, to induce adoption of an alternative cell fate, is an essential developmental mechanism. Similarly, domain and boundary establishment are crucial steps to forming organs during development. Notch signaling is a pathway ideally suited to mediating precise patterning cues, as both receptors and ligands are membrane-bound and can thus act as a precise switch to toggle cell fates on or off. Fine-tuning of signaling by positive or negative feedback mechanisms dictate whether signaling results in lateral induction or lateral inhibition, respectively, allowing Notch to either induce entire regions of cell specification, or dictate binary fate choices. Furthermore, pathway activity is modulated by Fringe modification of receptors or ligands, co-expression of receptors with ligands, mode of ligand presentation, and cell surface area in contact. In this review, we describe how Notch signaling is fine-tuned to mediate lateral induction or lateral inhibition cues, and discuss examples from C.elegans, D. melanogaster and M. musculus. Identifying the cellular machinery dictating the choice between lateral induction and lateral inhibition highlights the versatility of the Notch signaling pathway in development.},

abstract = {Receptor-mediated apoptosis proceeds via two pathways: one requiring only a cascade of initiator and effector caspases (type I behavior) and the second requiring an initiator-effector caspase cascade and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (type II behavior). Here, we investigate factors controlling type I versus II phenotypes by performing Lyapunov exponent analysis of an ODE-based model of cell death. The resulting phase diagrams predict that the ratio of XIAP to pro-caspase-3 concentrations plays a key regulatory role: type I behavior predominates when the ratio is low and type II behavior when the ratio is high. Cell-to-cell variability in phenotype is observed when the ratio is close to the type I versus II boundary. By positioning multiple tumor cell lines on the phase diagram we confirm these predictions. We also extend phase space analysis to mutations affecting the rate of caspase-3 ubiquitylation by XIAP, predicting and showing that such mutations abolish all-or-none control over activation of effector caspases. Thus, phase diagrams derived from Lyapunov exponent analysis represent a means to study multi-factorial control over a complex biochemical pathway.},

The diffusion coefficients ranged from 3 x 10(-9) square centimeters per second to 5 x 10(-9) square centimeters per second, with greater than 90 percent of the chimeric proteins mobile. Extensive lateral diffusion of the chimeric proteins occurred between Golgi stacks. Thus, the chimeras diffuse rapidly and freely in Golgi membranes, which suggests that Golgi targeting and retention of these molecules does not depend on protein immobilization.},

In the absence of active caspases, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) triggers the innate immune cGAS/STING pathway, causing dying cells to secrete type I interferon. How cGAS gains access to mtDNA remains unclear. We used live-cell lattice light-sheet microscopy to examine the mitochondrial network in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We found that after BAK/BAX activation and cytochrome c loss, the mitochondrial network broke down and large BAK/BAX pores appeared in the outer membrane. These BAK/BAX macropores allowed the inner mitochondrial membrane to herniate into the cytosol, carrying with it mitochondrial matrix components, including the mitochondrial genome. Apoptotic caspases did not prevent herniation but dismantled the dying cell to suppress mtDNA-induced innate immune signaling.},

abstract = {The self-association or aggregation of rhodamine 6G (R6G) in aqueous and aqueous solutions containing primary alcohols, urea and tetraethylammonium bromide has been studied by using spectrophotometry. The concentration range from {\~{}} 1 × 10− 5 M to {\~{}} 2 × 10− 4 M was selected to avoid trimer and higher aggregate formation. The observed spectra were processed by chemometric technique to get the dimer dissociation constant and individual monomer-dimer spectra. The geometry of dimer, the twisted angle and the interaction energy between the molecules of rhodamine 6G in the dimeric species have been explained by employing molecular exciton theory. The effect of solvent has been checked by measuring the absorbance in the aqueous solutions of different solvents such as ethanol (10− 1 M to 10− 4 M), propan-1-ol (10− 1 M to 10− 4 M) and butan-1-ol (10− 1 M to 10− 4 M) and the properties evaluated have been explained in terms of the role of low concentration of solvent molecules in dye aggregation and there by affecting degree of association, interaction energy, dipole moments in monomer and dimer forms. Similar experiments were made on the aqueous dye solutions containing urea ({\~{}} 0.1 M–0.4 M) and tetraethylammonium bromide ({\~{}} 0.005 M–0.1 M). Also we have studied the concentration and solvent effects on the fluorescence emission spectra of rhodamine 6G (R6G) dye. The number of different pure organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, propan-1-ol, butan-1-ol and chloroform along with water as well as mixtures of organic solvents/urea/tetraethylammonium bromide (TEAB) in water has been used. The results have been explained in terms of bonding between dye molecule and solvents which affects the arrangement of molecules there by affecting extent of aggregation.},

abstract = {Homeostasis is a recurring theme in biology that ensures that regulated variables robustly—and in some systems, completely—adapt to environmental perturbations. This robust perfect adaptation feature is achieved in natural circuits by using integral control, a negative feedback strategy that performs mathematical integration to achieve structurally robust regulation1,2. Despite its benefits, the synthetic realization of integral feedback in living cells has remained elusive owing to the complexity of the required biological computations. Here we prove mathematically that there is a single fundamental biomolecular controller topology3 that realizes integral feedback and achieves robust perfect adaptation in arbitrary intracellular networks with noisy dynamics. This adaptation property is guaranteed both for the population-average and for the time-average of single cells. On the basis of this concept, we genetically engineer a synthetic integral feedback controller in living cells4 and demonstrate its tunability and adaptation properties. A growth-rate control application in Escherichia coli shows the intrinsic capacity of our integral controller to deliver robustness and highlights its potential use as a versatile controller for regulation of biological variables in uncertain networks. Our results provide conceptual and practical tools in the area of cybergenetics3,5, for engineering synthetic controllers that steer the dynamics of living systems3–9.},

abstract = {{\textless}h2{\textgreater}Summary{\textless}/h2{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Intratumoral heterogeneity is associated with aggressive tumor behavior, therapy resistance, and poor patient outcomes. Such heterogeneity is thought to be dynamic, shifting over periods of minutes to hours in response to signaling inputs from the tumor microenvironment. However, models of this process have been inferred from indirect or post-hoc measurements of cell state, leaving the temporal details of signaling-driven heterogeneity undefined. Here, we developed a live-cell model system in which microenvironment-driven signaling dynamics can be directly observed and linked to variation in gene expression. Our analysis reveals that paracrine signaling between two cell types is sufficient to drive continual diversification of gene expression programs. This diversification emerges from systems-level properties of the EGFR-RAS-ERK signaling cascade, including intracellular amplification of amphiregulin-mediated paracrine signals and differential kinetic filtering by target genes including Fra-1, c-Myc, and Egr1. Our data enable more precise modeling of paracrine-driven transcriptional variation as a generator of gene expression heterogeneity. A record of this paper's transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Gene regulatory interactions are context dependent, active in some cellular states but not in others. Stochastic fluctuations, or 'noise', in gene expression propagate through active, but not inactive, regulatory links. Thus, correlations in gene expression noise could provide a noninvasive means to probe the activity states of regulatory links. However, global, 'extrinsic', noise sources generate correlations even without direct regulatory links. Here we show that single-cell time-lapse microscopy, by revealing time lags due to regulation, can discriminate between active regulatory connections and extrinsic noise. We demonstrate this principle mathematically, using stochastic modeling, and experimentally, using simple synthetic gene circuits. We then use this approach to analyze dynamic noise correlations in the galactose metabolism genes of Escherichia coli. We find that the CRP-GalS-GalE feed-forward loop is inactive in standard conditions but can become active in a GalR mutant. These results show how noise can help analyze the context dependence of regulatory interactions in endogenous gene circuits. {\textcopyright} 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {In yeast, the transcription factor Crz1 is dephosphorylated and translocates into the nucleus in response to extracellular calcium. Here we show, using time-lapse microscopy, that Crz1 exhibits short bursts of nuclear localization (typically lasting 2 min) that occur stochastically in individual cells and propagate to the expression of downstream genes. Strikingly, calcium concentration controls the frequency, but not the duration, of localization bursts. Using an analytic model, we also show that this frequency modulation of bursts ensures proportional expression of multiple target genes across a wide dynamic range of expression levels, independent of promoter characteristics. We experimentally confirm this theory with natural and synthetic Crz1 target promoters. Another stress-response transcription factor, Msn2, exhibits similar, but largely uncorrelated, localization bursts under calcium stress suggesting that frequency-modulation regulation of localization bursts may be a general control strategy used by the cell to coordinate multi-gene responses to external signals.},

Trajectories are analyzed by machine-learning algorithms to directly monitor transitions between bound and free states. In particular, we measure the dwell time of tRNAs on ribosomes, and hence achieve direct measurements of translation rates inside living cells at codon resolution. We find elongation rates with tRNAPhe that are in perfect agreement with previous indirect estimates, and once fMet-tRNAfMet has bound to the 30S ribosomal subunit, initiation of translation is surprisingly fast and does not limit the overall rate of protein synthesis.

Genetic manipulations have created a vast array of bright and stable FPs spanning blue to red spectral regions. Common to autofluorescent FPs is their tight b-barrel structure, which provides the rigidity and chemical environment needed for effectual fluorescence. Despite the common structure, each FP has unique properties. Thus, there is no single ‘best' FP for every circumstance, and each FP has advantages and disadvantages. To guide decisions about which FP is right for a given application, we have quantitatively characterized the brightness, photostability, pH stability and monomeric properties of more than 40 FPs to enable straightforward and direct comparison between them. We focus on popular and/or top-performing FPs in each spectral region.},

Moreover, the number of purinosome-containing cells responded to dysregulation of mitochondrial function and metabolism. To explore the role of intracellular signaling, we performed a kinome screen using a label-free assay and found that mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) influenced purinosome assembly. mTOR inhibition reduced purinosome-mitochondria colocalization and suppressed purinosome formation stimulated by mitochondria dysregulation. Collectively, our data suggest an mTOR-mediated link between purinosomes and mitochondria, and a general means by which mTOR regulates nucleotide metabolism by spatiotemporal control over protein association.},

This deep learning-based approach provides an entirely new framework to conduct holographic imaging by rapidly eliminating twin-image and self-interference related spatial artifacts. Compared to existing approaches, this neural network based method is significantly faster to compute, and reconstructs improved phase and amplitude images of the objects using only one hologram, i.e., requires less number of measurements in addition to being computationally faster. We validated this method by reconstructing phase and amplitude images of various samples, including blood and Pap smears, and tissue sections. These results are broadly applicable to any phase recovery problem, and highlight that through machine learning challenging problems in imaging science can be overcome, providing new avenues to design powerful computational imaging systems.},

abstract = {Replication of Mononegavirales occurs in viral factories which form inclusions in the host-cell cytoplasm. For rabies virus, those inclusions are called Negri bodies (NBs). We report that NBs have characteristics similar to those of liquid organelles: they are spherical, they fuse to form larger structures, and they disappear upon hypotonic shock. Their liquid phase is confirmed by FRAP experiments. Live-cell imaging indicates that viral nucleocapsids are ejected from NBs and transported along microtubules to form either new virions or secondary viral factories. Coexpression of rabies virus N and P proteins results in cytoplasmic inclusions recapitulating NBs properties. This minimal system reveals that an intrinsically disordered domain and the dimerization domain of P are essential for Negri bodies-like structures formation. We suggest that formation of liquid viral factories by phase separation is common among Mononegavirales and allows specific recruitment and concentration of viral proteins but also the escape to cellular antiviral response.Negative strand RNA viruses, such as rabies virus, induce formation of cytoplasmic inclusions for genome replication. Here, Nikolic et al. show that these so-called Negri bodies (NBs) have characteristics of liquid organelles and they identify the minimal protein domains required for NB formation.},

abstract = {Mathematical equations are fundamental to modeling biological networks, but as networks get large and revisions frequent, it becomes difficult to manage equations directly or to combine previously developed models. Multiple simultaneous efforts to create graphical standards, rule-based languages, and integrated software workbenches aim to simplify biological modeling but none fully meets the need for transparent, extensible, and reusable models. In this paper we describe PySB, an approach in which models are not only created using programs, they are programs. PySB draws on programmatic modeling concepts from little b and ProMot, the rule-based languages BioNetGen and Kappa and the growing library of Python numerical tools. Central to PySB is a library of macros encoding familiar biochemical actions such as binding, catalysis, and polymerization, making it possible to use a high-level, action-oriented vocabulary to construct detailed models. As Python programs, PySB models leverage tools and practices from the open-source software community, substantially advancing our ability to distribute and manage the work of testing biochemical hypotheses. We illustrate these ideas using new and previously published models of apoptosis.},

abstract = {Many cancer entities and their associated cell line models are highly heterogeneous in their responsiveness to apoptosis inducers and, despite a detailed understanding of the underlying signaling networks, cell death susceptibility currently cannot be predicted reliably from protein expression profiles. Here, we demonstrate that an integration of quantitative apoptosis protein expression data with pathway knowledge can predict the cell death responsiveness of melanoma cell lines. By a total of 612 measurements, we determined the absolute expression (nM) of 17 core apoptosis regulators in a panel of 11 melanoma cell lines, and enriched these data with systems-level information on apoptosis pathway topology. By applying multivariate statistical analysis and multi-dimensional pattern recognition algorithms, the responsiveness of individual cell lines to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or dacarbazine (DTIC) could be predicted with very high accuracy (91 and 82{\%} correct predictions), and the most effective treatment option for individual cell lines could be pre-determined in silico. In contrast, cell death responsiveness was poorly predicted when not taking knowledge on protein-protein interactions into account (55 and 36{\%} correct predictions). We also generated mathematical predictions on whether anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members or x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) can be targeted to enhance TRAIL responsiveness in individual cell lines. Subsequent experiments, making use of pharmacological Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition or siRNA-based XIAP depletion, confirmed the accuracy of these predictions. We therefore demonstrate that cell death responsiveness to TRAIL or DTIC can be predicted reliably in a large number of melanoma cell lines when investigating expression patterns of apoptosis regulators in the context of their network-level interplay. The capacity to predict responsiveness at the cellular level may contribute to personalizing anti-cancer treatments in the future. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). High-throughput quantitative phase imaging (QPI) is essential to cellular phenotypes characterization as it allows high-content cell analysis and avoids adverse effects of staining reagents on cellular viability and cell signaling. Among different approaches, Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) is probably the most promising technique to realize high-throughput QPI by synthesizing a wide-field, high-resolution complex image from multiple angle-variably illuminated, low-resolution images. However, the large dataset requirement in conventional FPM significantly limits its imaging speed, resulting in low temporal throughput. Moreover, the underlying theoretical mechanism as well as optimum illumination scheme for high-accuracy phase imaging in FPM remains unclear. Herein, we report a high-speed FPM technique based on programmable annular illuminations (AIFPM). The optical-transfer-function (OTF) analysis of FPM reveals that the low-frequency phase information can only be correctly recovered if the LEDs are precisely located at the edge of the objective numerical aperture (NA) in the frequency space. By using only 4 low-resolution images corresponding to 4 tilted illuminations matching a 10×, 0.4 NA objective, we present the high-speed imaging results of in vitro Hela cells mitosis and apoptosis at a frame rate of 25 Hz with a full-pitch resolution of 655 nm at a wavelength of 525 nm (effective NA = 0.8) across a wide field-of-view (FOV) of 1.77 mm2, corresponding to a space-bandwidth-time product of 411 megapixels per second. Our work reveals an important capability of FPM towards high-speed high-throughput imaging of in vitro live cells, achieving video-rate QPI performance across a wide range of scales, both spatial and temporal.},

abstract = {The Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling pathway is important for multiple developmental processes and tissue maintenance in adults. Consequently, deregulated signaling is involved in a range of human diseases including cancer and developmental defects. A better understanding of the intricate regulatory mechanism and effect of physiological (active) and pathophysiological (hyperactive) WNT signaling is important for predicting treatment response and developing novel therapies. The constitutively expressed CTNNB1 (commonly and hereafter referred to as $\beta$-catenin) is degraded by a destruction complex, composed of amongst others AXIN1 and GSK3. The destruction complex is inhibited during active WNT signaling, leading to $\beta$-catenin stabilization and induction of $\beta$-catenin/TCF target genes. In this study we investigated the mechanism and effect of $\beta$-catenin stabilization during active and hyperactive WNT signaling in a combined in silico and in vitro approach. We constructed a Petri net model of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling including main players from the plasma membrane (WNT ligands and receptors), cytoplasmic effectors and the downstream negative feedback target gene AXIN2. We validated that our model can be used to simulate both active (WNT stimulation) and hyperactive (GSK3 inhibition) signaling by comparing our simulation and experimental data. We used this experimentally validated model to get further insights into the effect of the negative feedback regulator AXIN2 upon WNT stimulation and observed an attenuated $\beta$-catenin stabilization. We furthermore simulated the effect of APC inactivating mutations, yielding a stabilization of $\beta$-catenin levels comparable to the Wnt-pathway activities observed in colorectal and breast cancer. Our model can be used for further investigation and viable predictions of the role of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling in oncogenesis and development.},

Here, we elucidated a new resistance mechanism to a DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic through bimodal modulation of p53 activation dynamics. By combining single-cell imaging with computational modeling, we characterized a four-component regulatory module, which generates bimodal p53 dynamics through coupled feed-forward and feedback, and found that the inhibitory strength between ATM and Mdm2 determined the differential modular output between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cell lines. We further showed that the combinatorial inhibition of Mdm2 and Wip1 was an effective strategy to alter p53 dynamics in resistant cancer cells and sensitize their apoptotic response. Our results point to p53 pulsing as a potentially druggable mechanism that mediates chemoresistance.},

abstract = {Sub-diffraction microscopy enables bio-imaging with unprecedented clarity. However, most super-resolution methods require complex, costly purpose-built systems, involve image post-processing and struggle with sub-diffraction imaging in 3D. Here, we realize a conceptually different super-resolution approach which circumvents these limitations and enables 3D sub-diffraction imaging on conventional confocal microscopes. We refer to it as super-linear excitation-emission (SEE) microscopy, as it relies on markers with super-linear dependence of the emission on the excitation power. Super-linear markers proposed here are upconversion nanoparticles of NaYF4, doped with 20{\%} Yb and unconventionally high 8{\%} Tm, which are conveniently excited in the near-infrared biological window. We develop a computational framework calculating the 3D resolution for any viable scanning beam shape and excitation-emission probe profile. Imaging of colominic acid-coated upconversion nanoparticles endocytosed by neuronal cells, at resolutions twice better than the diffraction limit both in lateral and axial directions, illustrates the applicability of SEE microscopy for sub-cellular biology.},

abstract = {Caspases are a family of aspartate-specific cysteine proteases responsible for the biochemical and morphological changes that occur during the execution phase of apoptosis. The hierarchical ordering of caspases has been clearly established using dATP-activated cell lysates to model the intrinsic pathway induced by initial mitochondrial perturbation. In this model, caspase-9, the apical caspase, directly processes and activates the effector caspases, caspase-3 and -7, and then active caspase-3 but not caspase-7, processes caspase-2 and -6, and subsequently the activated caspase-6 processes caspase-8 and -10. To address the possibility that this model in vitro system might not reflect the precise ordering of caspases in intact cells, we have examined this possibility in cells induced to undergo apoptosis by activation of the intrinsic pathway. We have used caspase deficient cells, small interference RNA for caspase-6 and -7, and a specific caspase-3 inhibitor. In contrast to the earlier in vitro studies, we now show that in intact cells caspase-7 can also directly process and activate caspase-2 and -6. The processing of caspase-2 and -6 occurs within the cytoplasm and active caspase-6 is then responsible for both the processing of caspase-8 and the cleavage of caspase-6 substrates, including lamin A/C.},

abstract = {The Bcl-2-associated death promoter (BAD) protein, like many other BH3-only proteins, is known to promote apoptosis through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. Unlike the BH3-interacting domain death agonist (BID) protein, BAD cannot directly trigger apoptosis but, instead, lowers the threshold at which apoptosis is induced. In many mathematical models of apoptosis, BAD is neglected or abstracted. The work presented here considers the incorporation of BAD and its various modifications in a model of the tBID-induction of BAK (Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer) or the tBID-induction of BAX (Bcl-2-associated X protein). Steady state equations are used to develop an explicit formula describing the total concentration level of tBID, guaranteed to trigger apoptosis, as a bilinear function of the total BAD concentration level and the total anti-apoptotic protein concentration level (usually Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL). In particular, the formula explains how the pro-apoptotic protein BAD lowers the threshold at which tBID induces BAK/BAX activation-reducing the level of total Bcl-2/Bcl-xL available to inhibit tBID signaling in the mitochondria. Attention is then turned to the experimental data surrounding BAD phosphorylation, a process known to inhibit the pro-apoptotic effects of BAD. To address this data, the phosphorylation process is modeled following two separate kinetics in which either free unbound BAD is the assumed substrate or Bcl-xL/Bcl-2-bound BAD is the assumed substrate. Bifurcation analysis and further analysis of the bilinear equation validate experiments, which suggest that BAD phosphorylation prevents irreversible BAK/BAX-mediated apoptosis, even when phosphorylation-induced dissociation of Bcl-xL/Bcl-2-bound BAD is blocked. It is also shown that a cooperative, even synergistic, removal of mitochondrial BAD is seen when both types of phosphorylation are assumed possible. The presented work, however, reveals that the balance between BAD phosphorylation and dephosphorylation modulates the degree to which BAD influences the signaling from tBID to BAK/BAX. Our model shows that both the mode(s) of phosphorylation and the BAD dephosphorylation rate become important factors in determining whether BAD influences the activation of the BAK/BAX signal or not. Such potential variations in the pro-apoptotic effects of BAD are used to explain some of the inconsistent experimental data surrounding BAD phosphorylation. Nonetheless, our model serves to evaluate BAD and its sensitizing effects on the tBID-induction of BAK/BAX and thus aid in predicting when the incorporation of BAD in an apoptosis signaling model is important and when it is not. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Moreover, the number of purinosome-containing cells responded to dysregulation of mitochondrial function and metabolism. To explore the role of intracellular signaling, we performed a kinome screen using a label-free assay and found that mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) influenced purinosome assembly. mTOR inhibition reduced purinosome-mitochondria colocalization and suppressed purinosome formation stimulated by mitochondria dysregulation. Collectively, our data suggest an mTOR-mediated link between purinosomes and mitochondria, and a general means by which mTOR regulates nucleotide metabolism by spatiotemporal control over protein association.},

A reduction down to the apoptotic core machinery enables the application of analytical mathematical methods to evaluate the system behavior within a wide range of parameters. Using parameter values from the literature, the model reveals an unstable status of survival indicating the need for further control. Based on recent publications we tested one additional regulatory mechanism at the level of initiator caspase activation and demonstrated that the resulting system displays desired characteristics such as bistability. In addition, the results from our model studies allowed us to reconcile the fast kinetics of caspase 3 activation observed at the single cell level with the much slower kinetics found at the level of a cell population.},

Using time-lapse imaging of mouse cochlear explants, we show that hair cells rearrange gradually into a checkerboard-like pattern through a tissue-wide shear motion that coordinates intercalation and delamination events. Using mechanical models of the tissue, we show that global shear and local repulsion forces on hair cells are sufficient to drive the transition from disordered to ordered cellular pattern. Our findings suggest that mechanical forces drive ordered hair cell patterning in a process strikingly analogous to the process of shear-induced crystallization in polymer and granular physics.},

Here, we address this challenge by developing a suite of excitation ratiometric kinase activity biosensors that offer the highest reported dynamic range and enable the detection of subtle changes in signalling activity that could not be reliably detected previously, as well as a suite of single-fluorophore biosensors that enable the simultaneous tracking of as many as six distinct signalling activities in single living cells.},

The optical-transfer-function (OTF) analysis of FPM reveals that the low-frequency phase information can only be correctly recovered if the LEDs are precisely located at the edge of the objective numerical aperture (NA) in the frequency space. By using only 4 low-resolution images corresponding to 4 tilted illuminations matching a 10×, 0.4 NA objective, we present the high-speed imaging results of in vitro Hela cells mitosis and apoptosis at a frame rate of 25 Hz with a full-pitch resolution of 655 nm at a wavelength of 525 nm (effective NA = 0.8) across a wide field-of-view (FOV) of 1.77 mm2, corresponding to a space-bandwidth-time product of 411 megapixels per second. Our work reveals an important capability of FPM towards high-speed high-throughput imaging of in vitro live cells, achieving video-rate QPI performance across a wide range of scales, both spatial and temporal.},

abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) detection in fusion constructs consisting of green fluorescent protein (GFP) variants linked by a sequence that changes conformation upon modification by enzymes or binding of ligands has enabled detection of physiological processes such as Ca(2+) ion release, and protease and kinase activity. Current FRET microscopy techniques are limited to the use of spectrally distinct GFPs such as blue or cyan donors in combination with green or yellow acceptors. The blue or cyan GFPs have the disadvantages of less brightness and of autofluorescence. Here a FRET imaging method is presented that circumvents the need for spectral separation of the GFPs by determination of the fluorescence lifetime of the combined donor/acceptor emission by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). This technique gives a sensitive, reproducible, and intrinsically calibrated FRET measurement that can be used with the spectrally similar and bright yellow and green fluorescent proteins (EYFP/EGFP), a pair previously unusable for FRET applications. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in the analysis of single-cell signaling by monitoring caspase activity in individual cells during apoptosis.},

While confocal and two-photon microscopy have revolutionized biomedical research, current implementations are costly, complex and limited in their ability to image 3D volumes at high speeds. Light-sheet microscopy techniques using two-objective, orthogonal illumination and detection require a highly constrained sample geometry, and either physical sample translation or complex synchronization of illumination and detection planes. In contrast, SCAPE microscopy acquires images using an angled, swept light-sheet in a single-objective, en-face geometry. Unique confocal descanning and image rotation optics map this moving plane onto a stationary high-speed camera, permitting completely translationless 3D imaging of intact samples at rates exceeding 20 volumes per second. We demonstrate SCAPE microscopy by imaging spontaneous neuronal firing in the intact brain of awake behaving mice, as well as freely moving transgenic Drosophila larvae.},

abstract = {FLAP is a new method for localized photo-labelling and subsequent tracking of specific molecules within living cells. It is simple in principle, easy to implement and has a wide potential application. The molecule to be located carries two fluorophores: one to be photobleached and the other to act as a reference label. Unlike the related methods of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP), the use of a reference fluorophore permits the distribution of the photo-labelled molecules themselves to be tracked by simple image differencing. In effect, FLAP is therefore comparable with methods of photoactivation. Its chief advantage over the method of caged fluorescent probes is that it can be used to track chimaeric fluorescent proteins directly expressed by the cells. Although methods are being developed to track fluorescent proteins by direct photoactivation, these still have serious drawbacks. In order to demonstrate FLAP, we have used nuclear microinjection of cDNA fusion constructs of beta-actin with yellow (YFP) and cyan (CFP) fluorescent proteins to follow both the fast relocation dynamics of monomeric (globular) G-actin and the much slower dynamics of filamentous F-actin simultaneously in living cells.},

abstract = {Very simple biochemical systems regulated at the level of gene expression or protein function are capable of complex dynamic behaviour. Among the various patterns of regulation associated with non-linear kinetics, multistability, which corresponds to a true switch between alternate steady states, allows a graded signal to be turned into a discontinuous evolution of the system along several possible distinct pathways, which can be either reversible or irreversible. Multistability plays a significant role in some of the basic processes of life. It might account for maintenance of phenotypic differences in the absence of genetic or environmental differences, as has been demonstrated experimentally for the regulation of the lactose operon in Escherichia coli. Cell differentiation might also be explained as multistability.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Integrin adhesome proteins bind each other in alternative manners, forming within the cell diverse cell-matrix adhesion sites with distinct properties. An intriguing question is how such modular assembly of adhesion sites is achieved correctly solely by self-organization of their components. Here we address this question using high-throughput multiplexed imaging of eight proteins and two phosphorylation sites in a large number of single focal adhesions. We found that during the assembly of focal adhesions the variances of protein densities decrease while the correlations between them increase, suggesting reduction in the noise levels within these structures. These changes correlate independently with the area and internal density of focal adhesions, but not with their age or shape. Artificial neural network analysis indicates that a joint consideration of multiple components improves the predictability of paxillin and zyxin levels in internally dense focal adhesions. This suggests that paxillin and zyxin densities in focal adhesions are fine-tuned by integrating the levels of multiple other components, thus averaging-out stochastic fluctuations. Based on these results we propose that increase in internal protein densities facilitates noise suppression in focal adhesions, while noise suppression enables their stable growth and further density increase-hence forming a feedback loop giving rise to a quality-controlled assembly.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A key physiological mechanism employed by multicellular organisms is apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Apoptosis is triggered by the activation of caspases in response to both extracellular (extrinsic) and intracellular (intrinsic) signals. The extrinsic and intrinsic pathways are characterized by the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and the apoptosome, respectively; both the DISC and the apoptosome are oligomers with complex formation dynamics. Additionally, the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways are coupled through the mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel via the Bcl-2 family of proteins.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A model of caspase activation is constructed and analyzed. The apoptosis signaling network is simplified through modularization methodologies and equilibrium abstractions for three functional modules. The mathematical model is composed of a system of ordinary differential equations which is numerically solved. Multiple linear regression analysis investigates the role of each module and reduced models are constructed to identify key contributions of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways in triggering apoptosis for different cell lines.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Through linear regression techniques, we identified the feedbacks, dissociation of complexes, and negative regulators as the key components in apoptosis. The analysis and reduced models for our model formulation reveal that the chosen cell lines predominately exhibit strong extrinsic caspase, typical of type I cell, behavior. Furthermore, under the simplified model framework, the selected cells lines exhibit different modes by which caspase activation may occur. Finally the proposed modularized model of apoptosis may generalize behavior for additional cells and tissues, specifically identifying and predicting components responsible for the transition from type I to type II cell behavior.},

Here we describe an alternative mechanism for tissue contraction, based on individual cell volume change. We show that during Drosophila dorsal closure (DC), a wound healing-related process, the contraction of the amnioserosa (AS) is associated with a major reduction of the volume of its cells, triggered by caspase activation at the onset of the apoptotic program of AS cells. Cell volume decrease results in a contractile force that promotes tissue shrinkage. Estimating mechanical tensions with laser dissection and using 3D biophysical modeling, we show that the cell volume decrease acts together with the contraction of the actin cable surrounding the tissue to govern DC kinetics. Our study identifies a mechanism by which tissues generate forces and movements by modulating individual cell volume during development.},

abstract = {Apoptosis in response to TRAIL or TNF requires the activation of initiator caspases, which then activate the effector caspases that dismantle cells and cause death. However, little is known about the dynamics and regulatory logic linking initiators and effectors. Using a combination of live-cell reporters, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting, we find that initiator caspases are active during the long and variable delay that precedes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and effector caspase activation. When combined with a mathematical model of core apoptosis pathways, experimental perturbation of regulatory links between initiator and effector caspases reveals that XIAP and proteasome-dependent degradation of effector caspases are important in restraining activity during the pre-MOMP delay. We identify conditions in which restraint is impaired, creating a physiologically indeterminate state of partial cell death with the potential to generate genomic instability. Together, these findings provide a quantitative picture of caspase regulatory networks and their failure modes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Using 30-channel mass cytometry data, we show that Wishbone accurately recovers the known stages of T-cell development in the mouse thymus, including the bifurcation point. We also apply the algorithm to mouse myeloid differentiation and demonstrate its generalization to additional lineages.

Here, we show that cells use dynamics to discriminate signaling by the ligands Dll1 and Dll4 through the Notch1 receptor. Quantitative single-cell imaging revealed that Dll1 activates Notch1 in discrete, frequency-modulated pulses that specifically upregulate the Notch target gene Hes1. By contrast, Dll4 activates Notch1 in a sustained, amplitude-modulated manner that predominantly upregulates Hey1 and HeyL. Ectopic expression of Dll1 or Dll4 in chick neural crest produced opposite effects on myogenic differentiation, showing that ligand discrimination can occur in vivo. Finally, analysis of chimeric ligands suggests that ligand-receptor clustering underlies dynamic encoding of ligand identity. The ability of the pathway to utilize ligands as distinct communication channels has implications for diverse Notch-dependent processes. Notch ligands activate distinct targets through the same Notch receptor by triggering pulsatile or sustained activation dynamics.},

abstract = {Background: Co-expression of proteins is generally achieved by introducing two (or more) independent plasmids into cells, each driving the expression of a different protein of interest. However, the relative expression levels may vary strongly between individual cells and cannot be controlled. Ideally, co-expression occurs at a defined ratio, which is constant among cells. This feature is of particular importance for quantitative single cell studies, especially those employing bimolecular F{\"{o}}rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) sensors. Methodology/Principal Findings: Four co-expression strategies based on co-transfection, a dual promotor plasmid, an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and a viral 2A peptide were selected. Co-expression of two spectrally separable fluorescent proteins in single living cells was quantified. It is demonstrated that the 2A peptide strategy can be used for robust equimolar co-expression, while the IRES sequence allows expression of two proteins at a ratio of approximately 3:1. Combined 2A and IRES elements were used for the construction of a single plasmid that drives expression of three individual proteins, which generates a FRET sensor for measuring heterotrimeric G-protein activation. The plasmid drives co-expression of donor and acceptor tagged subunits, with reduced heterogeneity, and can be used to measure G-protein activation in single living cells. Conclusions/Significance: Quantitative co-expression of two or more proteins can be achieved with little cell-to-cell variability. This finding enables reliable co-expression of donor and acceptor tagged proteins for FRET studies, which is of particular importance for the development of novel bimolecular sensors that can be expressed from single plasmid. {\textcopyright} 2011 Goedhart et al.},

abstract = {Epidermal homeostasis depends on a balance between stem cell renewal and terminal differentiation. The transition between the two cell states, termed commitment, is poorly understood. Here, we characterise commitment by integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data from disaggregated primary human keratinocytes held in suspension to induce differentiation. Cell detachment induces several protein phosphatases, five of which - DUSP6, PPTC7, PTPN1, PTPN13 and PPP3CA – promote differentiation by negatively regulating ERK MAPK and positively regulating AP1 transcription factors. Conversely, DUSP10 expression antagonises commitment. The phosphatases form a dynamic network of transient positive and negative interactions that change over time, with DUSP6 predominating at commitment. Boolean network modelling identifies a mandatory switch between two stable states (stem and differentiated) via an unstable (committed) state. Phosphatase expression is also spatially regulated in vivo and in vitro. We conclude that an auto-regulatory phosphatase network maintains epidermal homeostasis by controlling the onset and duration of commitment.},

Such heterogeneity can be essential for many biological processes and is conjectured to arise from stochasticity, or noise, in gene expression. We constructed strains of Escherichia coli that enable detection of noise and discrimination between the two mechanisms by which it is generated. Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. These results establish a quantitative foundation for modeling noise in genetic networks and reveal how low intracellular copy numbers of molecules can fundamentally limit the precision of gene regulation.},

abstract = {Steady-state protein abundance is set by four rates: transcription, translation, mRNA decay and protein decay. A given protein abundance can be obtained from infinitely many combinations of these rates. This raises the question of whether the natural rates for each gene result from historical accidents, or are there rules that give certain combinations a selective advantage? We address this question using high-throughput measurements in rapidly growing cells from diverse organisms to find that about half of the rate combinations do not exist: genes that combine high transcription with low translation are strongly depleted. This depletion is due to a trade-off between precision and economy: high transcription decreases stochastic fluctuations but increases transcription costs. Our theory quantitatively explains which rate combinations are missing, and predicts the curvature of the fitness function for each gene. It may guide the design of gene circuits with desired expression levels and noise.},

Here we demonstrate that a neural network can learn to perform phase recovery and holographic image reconstruction after appropriate training. This deep learning-based approach provides an entirely new framework to conduct holographic imaging by rapidly eliminating twin-image and self-interference related spatial artifacts. Compared to existing approaches, this neural network based method is significantly faster to compute, and reconstructs improved phase and amplitude images of the objects using only one hologram, i.e., requires less number of measurements in addition to being computationally faster. We validated this method by reconstructing phase and amplitude images of various samples, including blood and Pap smears, and tissue sections. These results are broadly applicable to any phase recovery problem, and highlight that through machine learning challenging problems in imaging science can be overcome, providing new avenues to design powerful computational imaging systems.},

abstract = {The completion of genome sequences and subsequent high-throughput mapping of molecular networks have allowed us to study biology from the network perspective. Experimental, statistical and mathematical modeling approaches have been employed to study the structure, function and dynamics of molecular networks, and begin to reveal important links of various network properties to the functions of the biological systems. In agreement with these functional links, evolutionary selection of a network is apparently based on the function, rather than directly on the structure of the network. Dynamic modularity is one of the prominent features of molecular networks. Taking advantage of such a feature may simplify network-based biological studies through construction of process-specific modular networks and provide functional and mechanistic insights linking genotypic variations to complex traits or diseases, which is likely to be a key approach in the next wave of understanding complex human diseases. With the development of ready-to-use network analysis and modeling tools the networks approaches will be infused into everyday biological research in the near future. {\textcopyright} 2008 IBCB, SIBS, CAS All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Focal adhesions anchor contractile actin fibers with the extracellular matrix, sense the generated tension and respond to it by changing their morphology and composition. Here we ask how this mechanosensing is enabled at the protein-network level, given the modular assembly and multitasking of focal adhesions. To address this, we applied a sensitive 4-color live cell imaging approach, enabling monitoring patterns of molecular changes in single focal adhesions. Co-imaging zyxin, FAK, vinculin and paxillin revealed heterogeneities in their responses to Rho-associated kinase (ROCK)-mediated perturbations of actomyosin contractility. These responses were rather weakly correlated between the proteins, reflecting diverse compositional changes in different focal adhesions. This diversity is partially attributable to the location of focal adhesions, their area, molecular content and previous contractility perturbations, suggesting that integration of multiple local cues shapes differentially focal adhesion mechano-responsiveness. Importantly, the compositional changes upon ROCK perturbations exhibited distinct paths in different focal adhesions. Moreover, the protein exhibiting the strongest response to ROCK perturbations varied among different focal adhesions. The diversity in response patterns is plausibly enabled by the modular mode of focal adhesions assembly and can provide them the needed flexibility to perform multiple tasks by combining optimally a common set of multifunctional components.},

Akt fused to CRY2phr, which is a minimal light sensitive domain of CRY2 (CRY2-Akt), is reversibly activated by light illumination in several minutes within a physiological dynamic range and specifically regulates downstream molecules and inducible biological functions. We have generated a computational model of CRY2-Akt activation that allows us to use PA-Akt to control the activity quantitatively. The system provides evidence that the temporal patterns of Akt activity are crucial for generating one of the downstream functions of the Akt-FoxO pathway; the expression of a key gene involved in muscle atrophy (Atrogin-1). The use of an optical module with computational modeling represents a general framework for interrogating the temporal dynamics of biomolecules by predictive manipulation of optogenetic modules.},

Systems-level analysis - using high-density time-dependent measurements of signaling networks, gene expression profiles, and cell phenotypic responses in combination with mathematical modeling - revealed an approach for altering the intrinsic state of the cell through dynamic rewiring of oncogenic signaling pathways.

We show that synthetic fluorophores preserve their post-embedding fluorescence in the presence of uranyl acetate. Post-embedding fluorescence is of such quality that the specimen can be prepared with identical protocols for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM); this is particularly valuable when singular or otherwise difficult samples are examined. We show that synthetic fluorophores give bright, well-resolved signals in super-resolution light microscopy, enabling us to superimpose light microscopic images with a precision of up to 25. nm in the x y plane on electron micrographs.

abstract = {We describe a novel variant of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), denoted anisotropy-FLIM or rFLIM, which enables the wide-field measurement of the anisotropy decay of fluorophores on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We adapted existing frequency-domain FLIM technology for rFLIM by introducing linear polarizers in the excitation and emission paths. The phase delay and intensity ratios (AC and DC) between the polarized components of the fluorescence signal are recorded, leading to estimations of rotational correlation times and limiting anisotropies. Theory is developed that allows all the parameters of the hindered rotator model to be extracted from measurements carried out at a single modulation frequency. Two-dimensional image detection with a sensitive CCD camera provides wide-field imaging of dynamic depolarization with parallel interrogation of different compartments of a complex biological structure such as a cell. The concepts and technique of rFLIM are illustrated with a fluorophore-solvent (fluorescein-glycerol) system as a model for isotropic rotational dynamics and with bacteria expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) exhibiting depolarization due to homotransfer of electronic excitation energy (emFRET). The frequency-domain formalism was extended to cover the phenomenon of emFRET and yielded data consistent with a concentration depolarization mechanism resulting from the high intracellular concentration of EGFP. These investigations establish rFLIM as a powerful tool for cellular imaging based on rotational dynamics and molecular proximity.},

abstract = {Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a technique in which the mean fluorescence lifetime of a chromophore is measured at each spatially resolvable element of a microscope image. The nanosecond excited-state lifetime is independent of probe concentration or light path length but dependent upon excited-state reactions such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). These properties of fluorescence lifetimes allow exploration of the molecular environment of labelled macromolecules in the interior of cells. Imaging of fluorescence lifetimes enables biochemical reactions to be followed at each microscopically resolvable location within the cell.},

abstract = {We study the transition in dimensionality of a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic flow forced only mechanically, when the strength of a magnetic guiding field is gradually increased. We use numerical simulations to consider cases in which the mechanical forcing injects (or not) helicity in the flow. As the guiding field is increased, the strength of the magnetic field fluctuations decrease as a power law of the guiding field intensity. We show that for strong enough guiding fields, the helical magnetohydrodynamic flow can become almost two-dimensional. In this case, the mechanical energy can undergo a process compatible with an inverse cascade, being transferred preferentially towards scales larger than the forcing scale. The presence of helicity changes the spectral scaling of the small magnetic field fluctuations, and affects the statistics of the velocity field and of the velocity gradients. Moreover, at small scales the dynamics of the flow becomes dominated by a direct cascade of helicity, which can be used to derive scaling laws for the velocity field.},

abstract = {Individual cells within a population undergo apoptosis at distinct, apparently random time points. By analyzing cellular mitotic history, we identified that sibling HeLa cell pairs, in contrast to random cell pairs, underwent apoptosis synchronously. This allowed us to use high-speed cellular imaging to investigate mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), a highly coordinated, rapid process during apoptosis, at a temporal resolution approximately 100 times higher than possible previously. We obtained new functional and mechanistic insight into the process of MOMP: We were able to determine the kinetics of pore formation in the outer mitochondrial membrane from the initiation phase of cytochrome-c-GFP redistribution, and showed differential pore formation kinetics in response to intrinsic or extrinsic apoptotic stimuli (staurosporine, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)). We also detected that the onset of mitochondrial permeabilization frequently proceeded as a wave through the cytosol, and that the frequency of wave occurrence in response to TRAIL was reduced by inhibition of protein kinase CK2. Computational analysis by a partial differential equation model suggested that the spread of permeabilization signals could sufficiently be explained by diffusion-adsorption velocities of locally generated permeabilization inducers. Taken together, our study yielded the first comprehensive analysis of clonal cell-to-cell variability in apoptosis execution and allowed to visualize and explain the dynamics of MOMP in cells undergoing apoptosis.},

abstract = {Intestinal organoids are complex three-dimensional structures that mimic the cell-type composition and tissue organization of the intestine by recapitulating the self-organizing ability of cell populations derived from a single intestinal stem cell. Crucial in this process is a first symmetry-breaking event, in which only a fraction of identical cells in a symmetrical sphere differentiate into Paneth cells, which generate the stem-cell niche and lead to asymmetric structures such as the crypts and villi. Here we combine single-cell quantitative genomic and imaging approaches to characterize the development of intestinal organoids from single cells. We show that their development follows a regeneration process that is driven by transient activation of the transcriptional regulator YAP1. Cell-to-cell variability in YAP1, emerging in symmetrical spheres, initiates Notch and DLL1 activation, and drives the symmetry-breaking event and formation of the first Paneth cell. Our findings reveal how single cells exposed to a uniform growth-promoting environment have the intrinsic ability to generate emergent, self-organized behaviour that results in the formation of complex multicellular asymmetric structures.},

@article{Kutumova2013,
abstract = {Background: Many mathematical models characterizing mechanisms of cell fate decisions have been constructed recently. Their further study may be impossible without development of methods of model composition, which is complicated by the fact that several models describing the same processes could use different reaction chains or incomparable sets of parameters. Detailed models not supported by sufficient volume of experimental data suffer from non-unique choice of parameter values, non-reproducible results, and difficulty of analysis. Thus, it is necessary to reduce existing models to identify key elements determining their dynamics, and it is also required to design the methods allowing us to combine them.Results: Here we propose a new approach to model composition, based on reducing several models to the same level of complexity and subsequent combining them together. Firstly, we suggest a set of model reduction tools that can be systematically applied to a given model. Secondly, we suggest a notion of a minimal complexity model. This model is the simplest one that can be obtained from the original model using these tools and still able to approximate experimental data. Thirdly, we propose a strategy for composing the reduced models together. Connection with the detailed model is preserved, which can be advantageous in some applications. A toolbox for model reduction and composition has been implemented as part of the BioUML software and tested on the example of integrating two previously published models of the CD95 (APO-1/Fas) signaling pathways. We show that the reduced models lead to the same dynamical behavior of observable species and the same predictions as in the precursor models. The composite model is able to recapitulate several experimental datasets which were used by the authors of the original models to calibrate them separately, but also has new dynamical properties.Conclusion: Model complexity should be comparable to the complexity of the data used to train the model. Systematic application of model reduction methods allows implementing this modeling principle and finding models of minimal complexity compatible with the data. Combining such models is much easier than of precursor models and leads to new model properties and predictions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Kutumova et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Fluorescent protein-based biosensors have enabled the real-time monitoring of dynamic signalling processes within the native context of living cells, yet most commonly used biosensors exhibit poor sensitivity (for example, due to low dynamic range) and are limited to imaging signalling activities in isolation. Here, we address this challenge by developing a suite of excitation ratiometric kinase activity biosensors that offer the highest reported dynamic range and enable the detection of subtle changes in signalling activity that could not be reliably detected previously, as well as a suite of single-fluorophore biosensors that enable the simultaneous tracking of as many as six distinct signalling activities in single living cells.},

abstract = {Wnt pathway deregulation is a common characteristic of many cancers. Only colorectal cancer predominantly harbours mutations in APC, whereas other cancer types (hepatocellular carcinoma, solid pseudopapillary tumours of the pancreas) have activating mutations in $\beta$-catenin (CTNNB1). We have compared the dynamics and the potency of $\beta$-catenin mutations in vivo. Within the murine small intestine (SI), an activating mutation of $\beta$-catenin took much longer to achieve Wnt deregulation and acquire a crypt-progenitor cell (CPC) phenotype than Apc or Gsk3 loss. Within the colon, a single activating mutation of $\beta$-catenin was unable to drive Wnt deregulation or induce the CPC phenotype. This ability of $\beta$-catenin mutation to differentially transform the SI versus the colon correlated with higher expression of E-cadherin and a higher number of E-cadherin:$\beta$-catenin complexes at the membrane. Reduction in E-cadherin synergised with an activating mutation of $\beta$-catenin resulting in a rapid CPC phenotype within the SI and colon. Thus, there is a threshold of $\beta$-catenin that is required to drive transformation, and E-cadherin can act as a buffer to sequester mutated $\beta$-catenin.},

Although the technique is relatively old, its application to studying endogenous intracellular proteins in living cells is relatively recent and is a consequence of the newly developed fluorescent protein-based living cell protein tags. This is particularly true for nuclear proteins, in which endogenous protein mobility has only recently been studied. Here we examine the experimental design and analysis of FRAP experiments. Mathematical modeling of FRAP data enables the experimentalist to extract information such as the association and dissociation constants, distribution of a protein between mobile and immobilized pools, and the effective diffusion coefficient of the molecule under study. As experimentalists begin to dissect the relative influence of protein domains within individual proteins, this approach will allow a quantitative assessment of the relative influences of different molecular interactions on the steady-state distribution and protein function in vivo. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Pan-cancer computational histopathology (PC-CHiP) classifies the tissue origin across organ sites and provides highly accurate, spatially resolved tumor and normal distinction within a given slide. The learned computational histopathological features correlate with a large range of recurrent genetic aberrations, including whole genome duplications (WGDs), arm-level copy number gains and losses, focal amplifications and deletions as well as driver gene mutations within a range of cancer types. WGDs can be predicted in 25/27 cancer types (mean AUC=0.79) including those that were not part of model training. Similarly, we observe associations with 25{\%} of mRNA transcript levels, which enables to learn and localise histopathological patterns of molecularly defined cell types on each slide. Lastly, we find that computational histopathology provides prognostic information augmenting histopathological subtyping and grading in the majority of cancers assessed, which pinpoints prognostically relevant areas such as necrosis or infiltrating lymphocytes on each tumour section. Taken together, these findings highlight the large potential of PC-CHiP to discover new molecular and prognostic associations, which can augment diagnostic workflows and lay out a rationale for integrating molecular and histopathological data.},

abstract = {Caspases are thought to be important players in the execution process of apoptosis. Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) are able to block caspases and therefore apoptosis. The fact that a subgroup of the IAP family inhibits active caspases implies that not each caspase activation necessarily leads to apoptosis. In such a scenario, however, processed and enzymically active caspases should somehow be removed. Indeed, IAP-caspase complexes covalently bind ubiquitin, resulting in degradation by the 26S proteasome. Following release from mitochondria, IAP antagonists (e.g. second mitochondrial activator of caspases (Smac)) inactivate IAPs. Moreover, although pro-apoptotic factors such as irradiation or anti-cancer drugs may release Smac from mitochondria in tumor cells, high cytoplasmic survivin and ML-IAP levels might be able to neutralize it and, consequently, IAPs would further be able to bind activated caspases. Here, we propose a simple mathematical model, describing the molecular interactions between Smac deactivators, Smac, IAPs, and caspase-3, including the requirements for both induction and prevention of apoptosis, respectively. In addition, we predict a novel mechanism of caspase-3 degradation that might be particularly relevant in long-living cells. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise.

abstract = {We performed in silico modeling of the regulatory network of mitochondrial apoptosis through which we examined the role of a Bax-activation switch in governing the mitochondrial apoptosis decision. Two distinct modeling methods were used in this article. One is continuous and deterministic, comprised of a set of ordinary differential equations. The other, carried out in a discrete manner, is based on a cellular automaton, which takes stochastic fluctuations into consideration. We focused on dynamic properties of the mitochondrial apoptosis regulatory network. The roles of Bcl-2 family proteins in cellular responses to apoptotic stimuli were examined. In our simulations, a self-amplification process of Bax-activation is indicated. Further analysis suggests that the core module of Bax-activation is bistable in both deterministic and stochastic models, and this feature is robust to noise and wide ranges of parameter variation. When coupling with Bax-polymerization, it forms a one-way-switch, which governs irreversible behaviors of Bax-activation even with attenuation of apoptotic stimulus. Together with the growing biochemical evidence, we propose a novel molecular switch mechanism embedded in the mitochondrial apoptosis regulatory network and give a plausible explanation for the all-or-none, irreversible character of mitochondrial apoptosis. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Phase recovery from intensity-only measurements forms the heart of coherent imaging techniques and holography. Here we demonstrate that a neural network can learn to perform phase recovery and holographic image reconstruction after appropriate training. This deep learning-based approach provides an entirely new framework to conduct holographic imaging by rapidly eliminating twin-image and self-interference related spatial artifacts. Compared to existing approaches, this neural network based method is significantly faster to compute, and reconstructs improved phase and amplitude images of the objects using only one hologram, i.e., requires less number of measurements in addition to being computationally faster. We validated this method by reconstructing phase and amplitude images of various samples, including blood and Pap smears, and tissue sections. These results are broadly applicable to any phase recovery problem, and highlight that through machine learning challenging problems in imaging science can be overcome, providing new avenues to design powerful computational imaging systems.},

abstract = {We propose a mathematical model for mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, in which kinetic cooperativity in formation of the apoptosome is a key element ensuring bistability. We examine the role of Bax and Bcl-2 synthesis and degradation rates, as well as the number of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTPs), on the cell response to apoptotic stimuli. Our analysis suggests that cooperative apoptosome formation is a mechanism for inducing bistability, much more robust than that induced by other mechanisms, such as inhibition of caspase-3 by the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP). Simulations predict a pathological state in which cells will exhibit a monostable cell survival if Bax degradation rate is above a threshold value, or if Bax expression rate is below a threshold value. Otherwise, cell death or survival occur depending on initial caspase-3 levels. We show that high expression rates of Bcl-2 can counteract the effects of Bax. Our simulations also demonstrate a monostable (pathological) apoptotic response if the number of MPTPs exceeds a threshold value. This study supports our contention, based on mathematical modeling, that cooperativity in apoptosome formation is critically important for determining the healthy responses to apoptotic stimuli, and helps define the roles of Bax, Bcl-2, and MPTP vis-{\`{a}}-vis apoptosome formation. {\textcopyright} 2006 by the Biophysical Society.},

@article{Bertaux2014,
abstract = {Isogenic cells sensing identical external signals can take markedly different decisions. Such decisions often correlate with pre-existing cell-to-cell differences in protein levels. When not neglected, these differences are accounted for in a static manner by assuming randomly-distributed initial protein levels. Capturing the actual temporal fluctuations of protein levels resulting from protein stochastic turnover would be more appropriate. Adopting this dynamical view on noise amounts to recast extrinsic variability into intrinsic noise. Here, we propose a generic approach to merge in a systematic and principled manner signal transduction models with stochastic protein turnover models. When applied to an established kinetic model of TRAIL-induced apoptosis, our approach markedly increased model prediction capabilities. One obtains a mechanistic explanation of yet-unexplained observations on fractional killing and non-trivial robust predictions of the temporal evolution of cell resistance to TRAIL. Our results challenge the role of surviving pathways in cell survival since no TRAIL-induced regulations are needed and strongly suggest that short-lived anti-apoptotic proteins Flip/Mcl1 exhibit large and rare fluctuations. More generally, our results highlight the importance of accounting for stochastic protein turnover to quantitatively understand signal transduction over extended durations, and imply that fluctuations of short-lived proteins deserve particular attention.},

Here we show that this relation, which we call the gene regulation function (GRF), fluctuates dynamically in individual living cells, thereby limiting the accuracy with which transcriptional genetic circuits can transfer signals. Using fluorescent reporter genes and fusion proteins, we characterized the bacteriophage lambda promoter PR in Escherichia coli. A novel technique based on binomial errors in protein partitioning enabled calibration of in vivo biochemical parameters in molecular units. We found that protein production rates fluctuate over a time scale of about one cell cycle, while intrinsic noise decays rapidly. Thus, biochemical parameters, noise, and slowly varying cellular states together determine the effective single-cell GRF. These results can form a basis for quantitative modeling of natural gene circuits and for design of synthetic ones.},

abstract = {Background: Coupled biological oscillators can tick with the same period. How this collective period is established is a key question in understanding biological clocks. We explore this question in the segmentation clock, a population of coupled cellular oscillators in the vertebrate embryo that sets the rhythm of somitogenesis, the morphological segmentation of the body axis. The oscillating cells of the zebrafish segmentation clock are thought to possess noisy autonomous periods, which are synchronized by intercellular coupling through the Delta-Notch pathway. Here we ask whether Delta-Notch coupling additionally influences the collective period of the segmentation clock. Results: Using multiple-embryo time-lapse microscopy, we show that disruption of Delta-Notch intercellular coupling increases the period of zebrafish somitogenesis. Embryonic segment length and the spatial wavelength of oscillating gene expression also increase correspondingly, indicating an increase in the segmentation clock's period. Using a theory based on phase oscillators in which the collective period self-organizes because of time delays in coupling, we estimate the cell-autonomous period, the coupling strength, and the coupling delay from our data. Further supporting the role of coupling delays in the clock, we predict and experimentally confirm an instability resulting from decreased coupling delay time. Conclusions: Synchronization of cells by Delta-Notch coupling regulates the collective period of the segmentation clock. Our identification of the first segmentation clock period mutants is a critical step toward a molecular understanding of temporal control in this system. We propose that collective control of period via delayed coupling may be a general feature of biological clocks. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Activation of effector caspases is a final step during apoptosis. Single-cell imaging studies have demonstrated that this process may occur as a rapid, all-or-none response, triggering a complete substrate cleavage within 15 min. Based on biochemical data from HeLa cells, we have developed a computational model of apoptosome-dependent caspase activation that was sufficient to remodel the rapid kinetics of effector caspase activation observed in vivo. Sensitivity analyses predicted a critical role for caspase-3-dependent feedback signalling and the X-linked-inhibitor-of-apoptosis-protein (XIAP), but a less prominent role for the XIAP antagonist Smac. Single-cell experiments employing a caspase fluorescence resonance energy transfer substrate verified these model predictions qualitatively and quantitatively. XIAP was predicted to control this all-or-none response, with concentrations as high as 0.15 microM enabling, but concentrations {\textgreater}0.30 microM significantly blocking substrate cleavage. Overexpression of XIAP within these threshold concentrations produced cells showing slow effector caspase activation and submaximal substrate cleavage. Our study supports the hypothesis that high levels of XIAP control caspase activation and substrate cleavage, and may promote apoptosis resistance and sublethal caspase activation in vivo.},

The ability of this network to coordinate and process a variety of inputs from different growth-factor receptors into specific biological responses is, however, still not understood. We investigated how the MAPK network brings about signal specificity in PC-12 cells, a model for neuronal differentiation. Reverse engineering by modular-response analysis uncovered topological differences in the MAPK core network dependent on whether cells were activated with epidermal or neuronal growth factor (EGF or NGF). On EGF stimulation, the network exhibited negative feedback only, whereas a positive feedback was apparent on NGF stimulation. The latter allows for bi-stable Erk activation dynamics, which were indeed observed. By rewiring these regulatory feedbacks, we were able to reverse the specific cell responses to EGF and NGF. These results show that growth factor context determines the topology of the MAPK signalling network and that the resulting dynamics govern cell fate.},

However, contrary to the previous reports, both DR4- and DR5-induced apoptosis can be blocked by dominant-negative FADD, and both receptors can activate NF-$\kappa$B using a TRADD-dependent pathway. Finally, both receptors can interact with FADD, TRADD, and RIP. Thus, both DR5 and DR4 use FADD, TRADD, and RIP in their signal transduction pathways, and FADD is the common mediator of apoptosis by all known death domain–containing receptors.},

By photostimulation of Mito-KillerRed, we induced caspase-3 activity in defined dendritic regions of cultured neurons. Within the photostimulated region, local elimination of dendritic spines and dendrite retraction occurred in a caspase-3-dependent manner without inducing cell death. However, pharmacological inhibition of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins or proteasome function led to neuronal death, suggesting that caspase activation is spatially restricted by these "molecular brakes" on apoptosis.

It is thus unclear how such systems can coordinate complex cell responses to external cues. Here, we analyze information transmission in the MAPK/ERK pathway that features relaxation oscillations and responds to EGF by pulses of activated ERK. Based on an experimentally verified computational model of the MAPK/ERK pathway, we demonstrate that when input sequences of EGF pulses are transcoded to output sequences of ERK activity pulses, transmitted information increases nearly linearly with time. Moreover, the information channel capacity C (defined as the upper limit of information that can be transmitted over a sufficiently long time t, divided by t), is not limited by the bandwidth B = 1/$\tau$, where $\tau$ ≈ 1 hour is the relaxation time. Specifically, when input is provided in the form of sequences of short binary EGF pulses separated by varying intervals that are multiples of $\tau$/n (but are not shorter than $\tau$), then for n = 2, C ≈ 1.39 bit/hour; and for n = 4, C ≈ 1.86 bit/hour. We hypothesize that the primary mode of operation of the MAPK pathway is to translate extracellular growth factor “bursts” into precisely timed intracellular ERK “spikes” of a predefined amplitude. Such pulse-interval transcoding allows to relay more information than the amplitude–amplitude transcoding considered previously for the ERK and NF-$\kappa$B pathways.},

abstract = {Tumor-host interactions play an increasingly recognized role in modulating tumor growth. Thus, understanding the nature and impact of this complex bidirectional communication is key to identifying successful anti-cancer strategies. It has been proposed that tumor cells compete with and kill neighboring host tissue to clear space that they can expand into; however, this has not been demonstrated experimentally. Here we use the adult fly intestine to investigate the existence and characterize the role of competitive tumor-host interactions. We show that APC-/--driven intestinal adenomas compete with and kill surrounding cells, causing host tissue attrition. Importantly, we demonstrate that preventing cell competition, by expressing apoptosis inhibitors, restores host tissue growth and contains adenoma expansion, indicating that cell competition is essential for tumor growth. We further show that JNK signaling is activated inside the tumor and in nearby tissue and is required for both tumor growth and cell competition. Lastly, we find that APC-/- cells display higher Yorkie (YAP) activity than host cells and that this promotes tumor growth, in part via cell competition. Crucially, we find that relative, rather than absolute, Hippo activity determines adenoma growth. Overall, our data indicate that the intrinsic over-proliferative capacity of APC-/- cells is not uncontrolled and can be constrained by host tissues if cell competition is inhibited, suggesting novel possible therapeutic approaches.},

abstract = {Fluorescence microscopy is a powerful approach for studying subcellular dynamics at high spatiotemporal resolution; however, conventional fluorescence microscopy techniques are light-intensive and introduce unnecessary photodamage. Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) mitigates these problems by selectively illuminating the focal plane of the detection objective by using orthogonal excitation. Orthogonal excitation requires geometries that physically limit the detection objective numerical aperture (NA), thereby limiting both light-gathering efficiency (brightness) and native spatial resolution. We present a novel live-cell LSFM method, lateral interference tilted excitation (LITE), in which a tilted light sheet illuminates the detection objective focal plane without a sterically limiting illumination scheme. LITE is thus compatible with any detection objective, including oil immersion, without an upper NA limit. LITE combines the low photodamage of LSFM with high resolution, high brightness, and coverslip-based objectives. We demonstrate the utility of LITE for imaging animal, fungal, and plant model organisms over many hours at high spatiotemporal resolution.},

A key approach for elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms is to probe the existence of oligomers directly in living cells. In this work, we were able to monitor the process of aggregation of Concanavalin A in live cells. We used number and brightness analysis, two-color cross number and brightness analysis, and Raster image correlation spectroscopy to obtain the number of molecules, aggregation state, and diffusion coefficient as a function of time and cell location. We observed that binding of Concanavalin A to the membrane and the formation of small aggregates paralleled cell morphology changes, indicating progressive cell compaction and death. Upon protein aggregation, we observed increased membrane water penetration as reported by Laurdan generalized polarization imaging. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Biophysical Society.},

Understanding this diversity and its biological meaning requires a theoretical framework, which could in turn guide the development of more accurate prognosis and therapy. Here, we review the theory of multi-task evolution of cancer, which is based upon the premise that tumours evolve in the host and face selection trade-offs between multiple biological functions. This theory can help identify the major biological tasks that cancer cells perform and the trade-offs between these tasks. It introduces the concept of specialist tumours, which focus on one task, and generalist tumours, which perform several tasks. Specialist tumours are suggested to be sensitive to therapy targeting their main task. Driver mutations tune gene expression towards specific tasks in a tissue-dependent manner and thus help to determine whether a tumour is specialist or generalist. We discuss potential applications of the theory of multi-task evolution to interpret the spatial organization of tumours and intratumour heterogeneity.},

By photostimulation of Mito-KillerRed, we induced caspase-3 activity in defined dendritic regions of cultured neurons. Within the photostimulated region, local elimination of dendritic spines and dendrite retraction occurred in a caspase-3-dependent manner without inducing cell death. However, pharmacological inhibition of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins or proteasome function led to neuronal death, suggesting that caspase activation is spatially restricted by these "molecular brakes" on apoptosis. Caspase-3 knock-out mice have increased spine density and altered miniature EPSCs, confirming a physiological involvement of caspase-3 in the regulation of spines in vivo.},

However, the very diversity that makes proteins so powerful also com- plicates efforts to harness them as well-controlled synthetic circuit components. Recent work has begun to address this challenge, focusing on principles such as orthogonality and composability that permit construc- tion of diverse circuit-level functions from a limited set of engineered protein components. These approaches are now enabling the engineering of circuits that can sense, transmit, and process information; dynamically control cellular behaviors; and enable new therapeutic strategies, establishing a powerful paradigm for pro- gramming biology.},

abstract = {Notch signaling is a conserved system of communication between adjacent cells, influencing numerous cell fate decisions in the development of multicellular organisms. Aberrant signaling is also implicated in many human pathologies. At its core, Notch has a mechanotransduction module that decodes receptor–ligand engagement at the cell surface under force to permit proteolytic cleavage of the receptor, leading to the release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). NICD enters the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional effector to regulate expression of Notch-responsive genes. In this article, we review and integrate current understanding of the detailed molecular basis for Notch signal transduction, highlighting quantitative, structural, and dynamic features of this developmentally central signaling mechanism. We discuss the implications of this mechanistic understanding for the functionality of the signaling pathway in different molecular and cellular contexts.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Biophysics, Volume 50 is May 2021.

By combining tracking of GEMs with genetic and pharmacological approaches, we discovered that the mTORC1 pathway can modulate the effective diffusion coefficient of particles ≥20 nm in diameter more than 2-fold by tuning ribosome concentration, without any discernable effect on the motion of molecules ≤5 nm. This change in ribosome concentration affected phase separation both in vitro and in vivo.

abstract = {The reproducibility crisis has emerged as an important concern across many fields of science including life science, since many published results failed to reproduce. Systems biology modelling, which involves mathematical representation of biological processes to study complex system behaviour, was expected to be least affected by this crisis. While lack of reproducibility of experimental results and computational analysis could be a repercussion of several compounded factors, it was not fully understood why systems biology models with well-defined mathematical expressions fail to reproduce and how prevalent it is. Hence, we systematically attempted to reproduce 455 kinetic models of biological processes published in peer-reviewed research articles from 152 journals; which is collectively a work of about 1400 scientists from 49 countries. Our investigation revealed that about half (49{\%}) of the models could not be reproduced using the information provided in the published manuscripts. With further effort, an additional 12{\%} of the models could be reproduced either by empirical correction or support from authors. The other 37{\%} remained non-reproducible models due to missing parameter values, missing initial concentration, inconsistent model structure, or a combination of these factors. Among the corresponding authors of the non-reproducible model we contacted, less than 30{\%} responded. Our analysis revealed that models published in journals across several fields of life science failed to reproduce, revealing a common problem in the peer-review process. Hence, we propose an 8-point reproducibility scorecard that can be used by authors, reviewers and journal editors to assess each model and address the reproducibility crisis.},

We use Bayesian and Monte Carlo methods to recover the full probability distributions of free parameters (initial protein concentrations and rate constants) for mass-action models of receptor-mediated cell death. The width of the individual parameter distributions is largely determined by non-identifiability but covariation among parameters, even those that are poorly determined, encodes essential information. Knowledge of joint parameter distributions makes it possible to compute the uncertainty of model-based predictions whereas ignoring it (e.g., by treating parameters as a simple list of values and variances) yields nonsensical predictions. Computing the Bayes factor from joint distributions yields the odds ratio (∼20-fold) for competing 'direct' and 'indirect' apoptosis models having different numbers of parameters. Our results illustrate how Bayesian approaches to model calibration and discrimination combined with single-cell data represent a generally useful and rigorous approach to discriminate between competing hypotheses in the face of parametric and topological uncertainty.},

As a proof of concept, we focused on the analysis of glutamatergic and GABAergic presynaptic axon terminals in the mouse hippocampal region to demonstrate its use as a tool to provide putative excitatory and inhibitory synaptic maps. The segmentation and quantification method has been validated over expert labeled images of the mouse hippocampus and over two benchmark datasets, obtaining comparable results to the expert detections.},

abstract = {A Fourier transform analysis of 2.5 million spectra in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey was carried out to detect periodic spectral modulations. Signals having the same period were found in only 234 stars overwhelmingly in the F2 to K1 spectral range. The signals cannot be caused by instrumental or data analysis effects because they are present in only a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral range and because signal to noise ratio considerations predict that the signal should mostly be detected in the brightest objects, while this is not the case. We consider several possibilities, such as rotational transitions in molecules, rapid pulsations, Fourier transform of spectral lines and signals generated by Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI). They cannot be generated by molecules or rapid pulsations. It is highly unlikely that they come from the Fourier transform of spectral lines because too many strong lines located at nearly periodic frequencies are needed. Finally we consider the possibility, predicted in a previous published paper, that the signals are caused by light pulses generated by Extraterrestrial Intelligence to makes us aware of their existence. We find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an ETI signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis. The fact that they are only found in a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral range centered near the spectral type of the sun is also in agreement with the ETI hypothesis. However, at this stage, this hypothesis needs to be confirmed with further work. Although unlikely, there is also a possibility that the signals are due to highly peculiar chemical compositions in a small fraction of galactic halo stars.},

abstract = {Transcription factor (TF) binding to DNA is fundamental for gene regulation. However, it remains unknown how the dynamics of TF-DNA interactions change during cell-fate determination in vivo. Here, we use photo-activatable FCS to quantify TF-DNA binding in single cells of developing mouse embryos. In blastocysts, the TFs Oct4 and Sox2, which control pluripotency, bind DNA more stably in pluripotent than in extraembryonic cells. By contrast, in the four-cell embryo, Sox2 engages in more long-lived interactions than does Oct4. Sox2 long-lived binding varies between blastomeres and is regulated by H3R26 methylation. Live-cell tracking demonstrates that those blastomeres with more long-lived binding contribute more pluripotent progeny, and reducing H3R26 methylation decreases long-lived binding, Sox2 target expression, and pluripotent cell numbers. Therefore, Sox2-DNA binding predicts mammalian cell fate as early as the four-cell stage. More generally, we reveal the dynamic repartitioning of TFs between DNA sites driven by physiological epigenetic changes. Video Abstract.},

abstract = {Hypoxia is known to be detrimental in cancer and contributes to its development. In this work, we present an approach to fate-map hypoxic cells in vivo in order to determine their cellular response to physiological O2 gradients as well as to quantify their contribution to metastatic spread. We demonstrate the ability of the system to fate-map hypoxic cells in 2D, and in 3D spheroids and organoids. We identify distinct gene expression patterns in cells that experienced intratumoral hypoxia in vivo compared to cells exposed to hypoxia in vitro. The intratumoral hypoxia gene-signature is a better prognostic indicator for distant metastasis-free survival. Post-hypoxic tumor cells have an ROS-resistant phenotype that provides a survival advantage in the bloodstream and promotes their ability to establish overt metastasis. Post-hypoxic cells retain an increase in the expression of a subset of hypoxia-inducible genes at the metastatic site, suggesting the possibility of a ‘hypoxic memory.'},

abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

Dose responses to isoproterenol (ISO), acetylcholine (ACh), and nitroglycerin (NTG) were examined in the same dogs before pacing (control) and after 4 to 7 weeks of rapid ventricular pacing, which induced congestive HF, characterized by increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (6.7±0.4 [control] versus 28±1.5 [HF] mm Hg) and decreased cardiac output (-30±5{\%}) and left ventricular dP/dt (-53±3{\%}), as well as ascites and peripheral edema. In the control state, TPR fell by 57±2{\%} in response to ISO (100 ng/kg), by 61±3{\%} in response to ACh (3 $\mu$g/kg), and by 55±2{\%} in response to NTG (10 $\mu$g/kg). In HF, smaller decreases (P{\textless}.05) in TPR were observed with the same doses of ISO (-50±2{\%}) and ACh (-49±2{\%}) but not with NTG (-58±3{\%}). Depressed responses to systemic ISO and ACh, but not NTG, were observed in HF in the presence of ganglionic blockade and also after local administration of smaller doses of the drugs in the absence of ganglionic blockade, but where systemic effects were not elicited. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase increased TPR to a greater degree before HF (+154±28{\%} [control]) than after (+80±22{\%} [HF]) and eliminated the depressed responses to ACh but not to ISO. $\beta$-Adrenergic receptor density, as determined by 125I-cyanopindolol binding in membrane preparations from mesenteric vessels was significantly decreased after HF (130±3 [control] versus 100±8 [HF] fmol/mg, P{\textless}.05) without any change in affinity. Thus, peripheral vascular $\beta$-adrenergic receptor downregulation occurs in HF, independent of altered endothelium-mediated peripheral vasodilation.},

abstract = {Ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a multistep protein degradation machinery implicated in many diseases. In the nervous system, UPS regulates remodeling and degradation of neuronal processes and is linked to Wallerian axonal degeneration, though the ubiquitin ligases that confer substrate specificity remain unknown. Having shown previously that class IV dendritic arborization (C4da) sensory neurons in Drosophila undergo UPS-mediated dendritic pruning during metamorphosis, we conducted an E2/E3 ubiquitinating enzyme mutant screen, revealing that mutation in ubcD1, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, resulted in retention of C4da neuron dendrites during metamorphosis. Further, we found that UPS activation likely leads to UbcD1-mediated degradation of DIAP1, a caspase-antagonizing E3 ligase. This allows for local activation of the Dronc caspase, thereby preserving C4da neurons while severing their dendrites. Thus, in addition to uncovering E2/E3 ubiquitinating enzymes for dendrite pruning, this study provides a mechanistic link between UPS and the apoptotic machinery in regulating neuronal process remodeling. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we developed a mathematical modeling framework for understanding the complex signaling behavior of CD95(APO-1/Fas)-mediated apoptosis. Defects in the regulation of apoptosis result in serious diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity, and neuro-degeneration. During the last decade many of the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis signaling have been examined and elucidated. A systemic understanding of apoptosis is, however, still missing. To address the complexity of apoptotic signaling we subdivided this system into subsystems of different information qualities. A new approach for sensitivity analysis within the mathematical model was key for the identification of critical system parameters and two essential system properties: modularity and robustness. Our model describes the regulation of apoptosis on a systems level and resolves the important question of a threshold mechanism for the regulation of apoptosis.},

GFP mutant S65T was purified from recombinant bacteria for solution studies, and expressed in CHO cell cytoplasm. GFP-S65T was brightly fluorescent in solution (lambda ex 492 nm, lambda em 509 nm) with a lifetime of 2.9 ns and a rotational correlation time (tc) of 20 ns. Recovery of GFP fluorescence after photobleaching was complete with a half-time (t1/2) in aqueous saline of 30 +/- 2 ms (5-micron diameter spot), giving a diffusion coefficient of 8.7 x 10(-7) cm2/s. The t1/2 was proportional to solution viscosity and was dependent on spot diameter. In contrast to fluorescein. GFP photobleaching efficiency was not affected by solution O2 content, triplet state quenchers, singlet oxygen scavengers, and general radical quenchers. In solutions of higher viscosity, an additional, rapid GFP recovery process was detected and ascribed to reversible photobleaching. The t1/2 for reversible photobleaching was 1.5-5.5 ms (relative viscosity 5-250), was independent of spot diameter, and was unaffected by O2 or quenchers. In cell cytoplasm, time-resolved microfluorimetry indicated a GFP lifetime of 2.6 ns and a tc of 36 +/- 3 ns, giving a relative viscosity (cytoplasm versus water) of 1.5. Photobleaching recovery of GFP in cytoplasm was 82 +/- 2{\%} complete with a t1/2 of 83 +/- 6 ms, giving a relative viscosity of 3.2. GFP translational diffusion increased 4.7-fold as cells swelled from a relative volume of 0.5 to 2. Taken together with measurements of GFP translation and rotation in aqueous dextran solutions, the data in cytoplasm support the view that the primary barrier to GFP diffusion is collisional interactions between GFP and macromolecular solutes.},

Here, we experimentally determine Lipofectamine- and PEI-mediated exogenous gene expression distributions from single cell time-lapse analysis. Broad Poisson-like distributions of steady state expression are observed for both transfection agents, when used with synchronized cell lines. At the same time, cotransfection analysis with YFP- and CFP-coding plasmids shows that multiple plasmids are simultaneously expressed, suggesting that plasmids are delivered in correlated units (complexes). We present a mathematical model of transfection, where a stochastic, two-step process is assumed, with the first being the low-probability entry step of complexes into the nucleus, followed by the subsequent release and activation of a small number of plasmids from a delivered complex. This conceptually simple model consistently predicts the observed fraction of transfected cells, the cotransfection ratio and the expression level distribution. It yields the number of efficient plasmids per complex and elucidates the origin of the associated noise, consequently providing a platform for evaluating and improving non-viral vectors. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {One of the big turning points in my life was a meeting with Enrico Fermi in the spring of 1953. In a few minutes, Fermi politely but ruthlessly demolished a programme of research that my students and I had been pursuing for several years. He probably saved us from several more years of fruitless wandering along a road that was leading nowhere. I am eternally grateful to him for destroying our illusions and telling us the bitter truth. Fermi was one of the great physicists of our time, outstanding both as a theorist and as an experimenter. He led the team that built the first nuclear reactor in Chicago in 1942. By 1953 he was head of the team that built the Chicago cyclotron, and was using it to explore the strong forces that hold nuclei together. He made the first accurate measurements of the scattering of mesons by protons, an experiment that gave the most direct evidence then available of the nature of the strong forces. At that time I was a young professor of theoretical physics at Cornell University, responsible for directing the research of a small army of graduate students and postdocs. I had put them to work calculating meson–proton scattering, so that their theoretical calculations could be compared with Fermi's measurements. In 1948 and 1949 we had made similar calculations of atomic processes, using the theory of quantum electrodynamics, and found spectacular agreement between experiment and theory. Quantum electrodynamics is the theory of electrons and photons interacting through electromagnetic forces. Because the electromagnetic forces are weak, we could calculate the atomic processes precisely. By 1951, we had triumphantly finished the atomic calculations and were looking for fresh fields to conquer. We decided to use the same techniques of calculation to explore the strong nuclear forces. We began by calculating meson–proton scattering, using a theory of the strong forces known as pseudoscalar meson theory. By the spring of 1953, after heroic efforts, we had plotted theoretical graphs of meson–proton scattering. We joyfully observed that our calculated numbers agreed pretty well with Fermi's measured numbers. So I made an appointment to meet with Fermi and show him our results. Proudly, I rode the Greyhound bus from Ithaca to Chicago with a package of our theoretical graphs to show to Fermi. When I arrived in Fermi's office, I handed the graphs to Fermi, but he hardly glanced at them. He invited me to sit down, and asked me in a friendly way about the health of my wife and our new-born baby son, now fifty years old. Then he delivered his verdict in a quiet, even voice. "There are two ways of doing calculations in theoretical physics", he said. "One way, and this is the way I prefer, is to have a clear physical picture of the process that you are calculating. The other way is to have a precise and self-consistent mathematical formalism. You have neither." I was slightly stunned, but ventured to ask him why he did not consider the pseudoscalar meson theory to be a self-consistent mathematical formalism. He replied, "Quantum electrodynamics is a good theory because the forces are weak, and when the formalism is ambiguous we have a clear physical picture to guide us. With the pseudoscalar meson theory there is no physical picture, and the forces are so strong that nothing converges. To reach your calculated results, you had to introduce arbitrary cut-off procedures that are not based either on solid physics or on solid mathematics." In desperation I asked Fermi whether he was not impressed by the agreement between our calculated numbers and his measured numbers. He replied, "How many arbitrary parameters did you use for your calculations?" I thought for a moment about our cut-off procedures and said, "Four." He said, "I remember my friend Johnny von Neumann used to say, with four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk." With that, the conversation was over. I thanked Fermi for his time and trouble, and sadly took the next bus back to Ithaca to tell the bad news to the students. Because it was important for the students to have their names on a published paper, we did not abandon our calculations immediately. We finished them and wrote a long paper that was duly published in the Physical Review with all our names on it. Then we dispersed to find other lines of work. I escaped to Berkeley, California, to start a new career in condensed-matter physics. Looking back after fifty years, we can clearly see that Fermi was right. The crucial discovery that made sense of the strong forces was the quark. Mesons and protons are little bags of quarks. Before Murray Gell-Mann discovered quarks, no theory of the strong forces could possibly have been adequate. Fermi knew nothing about quarks, and died before they were discovered. But somehow he knew that something essential was missing in the meson theories of the 1950s. His physical intuition told him that the pseudoscalar meson theory could not be right. And so it was Fermi's intuition, and not any discrepancy between theory and experiment, that saved me and my students from getting stuck in a blind alley.},

Here we examined the role of cooperativity in Notch signaling by CRISPR-mediated engineering of mice in which neither Notch1 nor Notch2 can homo- or heterodimerize, essential for cooperative binding to sequence-paired sites (SPS) located near many Notch-regulated genes. Although most known Notch-dependent phenotypes were unaffected in Notch1/2 dimer–deficient mice, a subset of tissues proved highly sensitive to loss of cooperativity. These phenotypes include heart development, compromised viability in combination with low gene dose, and the gut, developing ulcerative colitis in response to 1{\%} dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). The most striking phenotypes—gender imbalance and splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma—emerged in combination with gene dose reduction or when challenged by chronic fur mite infestation. This study highlights the role of the environment in malignancy and colitis and is consistent with Notch-dependent anti-parasite immune responses being compromised in Notch dimer–deficient animals.},

Understanding the role of apoptotic cells necessitates their efficient tracking within living tissues, a task which is currently challenging. In order to easily spot apoptotic cells in developing Drosophila tissues, we generated a series of fly lines expressing different fluorescent sensors of caspase activity. We show that three of these reporters (GFP, Cerulean and Venus derived molecules) are detected specifically in apoptotic cells and throughout the whole process of programmed cell death. These reporters allow the specific visualization of apoptotic cells directly within living tissues, without any post-acquisition processing. They overcome the limitations of other apoptosis detection methods developed so far and notably, they can be combined with any kind of fluorophore.},

Here we demonstrate that a neural network can learn to perform phase recovery and holographic image reconstruction after appropriate training. This deep learning-based approach provides an entirely new framework to conduct holographic imaging by rapidly eliminating twin-image and self-interference related spatial artifacts. Compared to existing approaches, this neural network based method is significantly faster to compute, and reconstructs improved phase and amplitude images of the objects using only one hologram, i.e., requires less number of measurements in addition to being computationally faster. We validated this method by reconstructing phase and amplitude images of various samples, including blood and Pap smears, and tissue sections. These results are broadly applicable to any phase recovery problem, and highlight that through machine learning challenging problems in imaging science can be overcome, providing new avenues to design powerful computational imaging systems.},

Besides regulating cell-fate decisions at an individual cell level, Notch signaling coordinates the emergent spatiotemporal patterning in a tissue through ligand-receptor interactions among transmembrane molecules of neighboring cells, as seen in embryonic development, angiogenesis, or wound healing. Due to its ubiquitous nature, Notch signaling is also implicated in several aspects of cancer progression, including tumor angiogenesis, stemness of cancer cells and cellular invasion. Here, we review experimental and computational models that help understand the operating principles of cell patterning driven by Notch signaling. First, we discuss the basic mechanisms of spatial patterning via canonical lateral inhibition and lateral induction mechanisms, including examples from angiogenesis, inner ear development and cancer metastasis. Next, we analyze additional layers of complexity in the Notch pathway, including the effect of varying cell sizes and shapes, ligand-receptor binding within the same cell, variable binding affinity of different ligand/receptor subtypes, and filopodia. Finally, we discuss some recent evidence of mechanosensitivity in the Notch pathway in driving collective epithelial cell migration and cardiovascular morphogenesis.},

Smaug orthologs have been shown to form membraneless organelles (MLOs) in several organisms and cell types. Using single-molecule FISH we show here that SDHB and UQCRC1 mRNAs associate with Smaug1 MLOs in the human cell line U2OS. Simultaneous loss of function of Smaug1 and Smaug2 affects both mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial network morphology. Deletion of specific Smaug1 protein regions resulted in impaired MLO formation that correlates with mitochondrial defects. In addition, rotenone but not the respiratory chain uncoupling agent CCCP rapidly induces Smaug1 MLO dissolution. Finally, metformin elicits a similar effect on Smaug1 MLOs and provokes the release of bounded mRNAs. We propose that mitochondrial activity affects Smaug1 MLO dynamics, thus allowing for regulation of nuclear mRNAs that encode key mitochondrial proteins.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Two of these, which use myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrate, act as kinase kinases in that they are able to activate a separate peptide kinase activity in vitro by a mechanism involving protein phosphorylation. In this study, we have identified two activities from extracts of epidermal growth factor-treated cells that stimulate an ATP-dependent activation of both of the MBP kinases, derived in their inactive precursor forms from extracts of untreated cells. The resulting MBP kinase activities are stable to further purification and can be inactivated with either tyrosine or serine/threonine protein phosphatases and then reactivated to their original levels of activity. Thus, we propose that the in vitro activation involves protein phosphorylation, stimulated by the action of novel MBP kinase activating factors that represent intermediate components in a growth factor-stimulated kinase cascade.},

abstract = {Transcription factor (TF) binding to DNA is fundamental for gene regulation. However, it remains unknown how the dynamics of TF-DNA interactions change during cell-fate determination in vivo. Here, we use photo-activatable FCS to quantify TF-DNA binding in single cells of developing mouse embryos. In blastocysts, the TFs Oct4 and Sox2, which control pluripotency, bind DNA more stably in pluripotent than in extraembryonic cells. By contrast, in the four-cell embryo, Sox2 engages in more long-lived interactions than does Oct4. Sox2 long-lived binding varies between blastomeres and is regulated by H3R26 methylation. Live-cell tracking demonstrates that those blastomeres with more long-lived binding contribute more pluripotent progeny, and reducing H3R26 methylation decreases long-lived binding, Sox2 target expression, and pluripotent cell numbers. Therefore, Sox2-DNA binding predicts mammalian cell fate as early as the four-cell stage. More generally, we reveal the dynamic repartitioning of TFs between DNA sites driven by physiological epigenetic changes. Video Abstract.},

abstract = {We report here the striking anisotropy of fluorescence exhibited by crystals of native green fluorescence protein (GFP). The crystals were generated by water dialysis of highly purified GFP obtained from the jellyfish Aequorea. We find that the fluorescence becomes six times brighter when the excitation, or emission, beam is polarized parallel (compared with perpendicular) to the crystal long axis. Thus, the major dipoles of the fluorophores must be oriented very nearly parallel to the crystal long axis. Observed in a polarizing microscope between parallel polars instead of either a polarizer or analyzer alone, the fluorescence polarization ratio rises to an unexpectedly high value of about 30:1, nearly the product of the fluorescence excitation and emission ratios, suggesting a sensitive method for measuring fluorophore orientations, even of a single fluorophore molecule. We have derived equations that accurately describe the relative fluorescence intensities of crystals oriented in various directions, with the polarizer and analyzer arranged in different configurations. The equations yield relative absorption and fluorescence coefficients for the four transition dipoles involved. Finally, we propose a model in which the elongated crystal is made of GFP molecules that are tilted 60 degrees to align the fluorophores parallel to the crystal long axis. The unit layer in the model may well correspond to the arrangement of functional GFP molecules, to which resonant energy is efficiently transmitted from Ca2+-activated aequorin, in the jellyfish photophores.},

Here we explore this behavior in two contexts: strain propagation in mechanical networks and pressure redistribution in flow networks. By adding and removing links, we are able to optimize both types of networks to perform specific functions. We define a single function as a tuned response of a single "target" link when another, predetermined part of the network is activated. Using network structures generated via such optimization, we investigate how many simultaneous functions such networks can be programmed to fulfill. We find that both flow and mechanical networks display qualitatively similar phase transitions in the number of targets that can be tuned, along with the same robust finite-size scaling behavior. We discuss how these properties can be understood in the context of a new class of constraint-satisfaction problems.},

abstract = {The stochastic motions of a diffusing particle contain information concerning the particle's interactions with binding partners and with its local environment. However, accurate determination of the underlying diffusive properties, beyond normal diffusion, has remained challenging when analyzing particle trajectories on an individual basis. Here, we introduce the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for confined diffusion and fractional Brownian motion. We demonstrate that this MLE yields improved estimation over traditional mean square displacement analyses. We also introduce a model selection scheme (that we call mleBIC) that classifies individual trajectories to a given diffusion mode. We demonstrate the statistical limitations of classification via mleBIC using simulated data. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new version of perturbation expectation-maximization (pEMv2), which simultaneously analyzes a collection of particle trajectories to uncover the system of interactions which give rise to unique normal and/or non-normal diffusive states within the population. We test and evaluate the performance of pEMv2 on various sets of simulated particle trajectories, which transition among several modes of normal and non-normal diffusion, highlighting the key considerations for employing this analysis methodology.},

abstract = {Our knowledge of the destructive events that regulate axonal degeneration is rudimentary. Here, we examine the role of caspases and their endogenous inhibitor, the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), in axonal degeneration of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) axons. We show that caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-9 are present in axons and are cleaved upon nerve growth factor (NGF) withdrawal. We observed that caspase-3 activity is high in NGF-withdrawn axons and that CASP3-/-axons are protected from degeneration. XIAP-/-DRG sensory neurons degenerate more rapidly and contain more active caspase-3 than their wild-type counterparts, indicating that axonal caspases are normally regulated by XIAP. Importantly, axonal XIAP levels drop sharply after NGF withdrawal; if XIAP levels are maintained by overexpression, axonal caspase-3 activation and axonal degeneration are suppressed. Finally, we show that XIAP-/-embryos have stunted dermal innervation. We propose that XIAP-mediated caspase inhibition plays an important role in regulating morphogenic events that shape the nervous system during development},

abstract = {Transcription factor (TF) binding to DNA is fundamental for gene regulation. However, it remains unknown how the dynamics of TF-DNA interactions change during cell-fate determination in vivo. Here, we use photo-activatable FCS to quantify TF-DNA binding in single cells of developing mouse embryos. In blastocysts, the TFs Oct4 and Sox2, which control pluripotency, bind DNA more stably in pluripotent than in extraembryonic cells. By contrast, in the four-cell embryo, Sox2 engages in more long-lived interactions than does Oct4. Sox2 long-lived binding varies between blastomeres and is regulated by H3R26 methylation. Live-cell tracking demonstrates that those blastomeres with more long-lived binding contribute more pluripotent progeny, and reducing H3R26 methylation decreases long-lived binding, Sox2 target expression, and pluripotent cell numbers. Therefore, Sox2-DNA binding predicts mammalian cell fate as early as the four-cell stage. More generally, we reveal the dynamic repartitioning of TFs between DNA sites driven by physiological epigenetic changes. Video Abstract.},

abstract = {Replication of Mononegavirales occurs in viral factories which form inclusions in the host-cell cytoplasm. For rabies virus, those inclusions are called Negri bodies (NBs). We report that NBs have characteristics similar to those of liquid organelles: they are spherical, they fuse to form larger structures, and they disappear upon hypotonic shock. Their liquid phase is confirmed by FRAP experiments. Live-cell imaging indicates that viral nucleocapsids are ejected from NBs and transported along microtubules to form either new virions or secondary viral factories. Coexpression of rabies virus N and P proteins results in cytoplasmic inclusions recapitulating NBs properties. This minimal system reveals that an intrinsically disordered domain and the dimerization domain of P are essential for Negri bodies-like structures formation. We suggest that formation of liquid viral factories by phase separation is common among Mononegavirales and allows specific recruitment and concentration of viral proteins but also the escape to cellular antiviral response.Negative strand RNA viruses, such as rabies virus, induce formation of cytoplasmic inclusions for genome replication. Here, Nikolic et al. show that these so-called Negri bodies (NBs) have characteristics of liquid organelles and they identify the minimal protein domains required for NB formation.},

@article{Legewie2006,
abstract = {The intrinsic, or mitochondrial, pathway of caspase activation is essential for apoptosis induction by various stimuli including cytotoxic stress. It depends on the cellular context, whether cytochrome c released from mitochondria induces caspase activation gradually or in an all-or-none fashion, and whether caspase activation irreversibly commits cells to apoptosis. By analyzing a quantitative kinetic model, we show that inhibition of caspase-3 (Casp3) and Casp9 by inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) results in an implicit positive feedback, since cleaved Casp3 augments its own activation by sequestering IAPs away from Casp9. We demonstrate that this positive feedback brings about bistability (i.e., all-or-none behaviour), and that it cooperates with Casp3-mediated feedback cleavage of Casp9 to generate irreversibility in caspase activation. Our calculations also unravel how cell-specific protein expression brings about the observed qualitative differences in caspase activation (gradual versus all-or-none and reversible versus irreversible). Finally, known regulators of the pathway are shown to efficiently shift the apoptotic threshold stimulus, suggesting that the bistable caspase cascade computes multiple inputs into an all-or-none caspase output. As cellular inhibitory proteins (e.g., IAPs) frequently inhibit consecutive intermediates in cellular signaling cascades (e.g., Casp3 and Casp9), the feedback mechanism described in this paper is likely to be a widespread principle on how cells achieve ultrasensitivity, bistability, and irreversibility. {\textcopyright} 2006 Legewie et al.},

Confocal FLIM systems based on time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) methods provide high spatial resolution and high sensitivity, but suffer from poor signal to noise ratios (SNR) that complicate quantitative analysis. We extend a global analysis method, originally developed for single frequency domain FLIM data, with a new filtering method optimized for FRET-FLIM data and apply it to TCSPC data. With this approach, the fluorescent lifetimes and relative concentrations of free and interacting molecules can be reliably estimated, even if the SNR is low. The required calibration values of the impulse response function are directly estimated from the data, eliminating the need for reference samples. The proposed method is efficient and robust, and can be routinely applied to analyze FRET-FLIM data acquired in intact cells.},

Live imaging, together with genetically encoded reporters, may provide the necessary tool to address this issue, permitting the in vivo monitoring of the spatial and temporal expression dynamics of a gene of interest during a variety of developmental processes. Canonical Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signalling controls a plethora of cellular activities during development, regeneration and adulthood throughout the animal kingdom. Several reporters have been produced in animal models to reveal sites of active Wnt signalling. In order to monitor in vivo Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signalling activity in the freshwater polyp Hydra vulgaris, we generated a $\beta$-cat-eGFP transgenic Hydra, in which eGFP is driven by the Hydra $\beta$-catenin promoter. We characterized the expression dynamics during budding, regeneration and chemical activation of the Wnt/$\beta$-cat signalling pathway using light sheet fluorescence microscopy. Live imaging of the $\beta$-cat-eGFP lines recapitulated the previously reported endogenous expression pattern of $\beta$-catenin and revealed the dynamic appearance of novel sites of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signalling, that earlier evaded detection by mean of in situ hybridization. By combining the Wnt activity read-out efficiency of the $\beta$-catenin promoter with advanced imaging, we have created a novel model system to monitor in real time the activity of Hydra $\beta$-cat regulatory sequences in vivo, and open the path to reveal $\beta$-catenin modulation in many other physiological contexts.},

This deep learning-based approach provides an entirely new framework to conduct holographic imaging by rapidly eliminating twin-image and self-interference related spatial artifacts. Compared to existing approaches, this neural network based method is significantly faster to compute, and reconstructs improved phase and amplitude images of the objects using only one hologram, i.e., requires less number of measurements in addition to being computationally faster. We validated this method by reconstructing phase and amplitude images of various samples, including blood and Pap smears, and tissue sections. These results are broadly applicable to any phase recovery problem, and highlight that through machine learning challenging problems in imaging science can be overcome, providing new avenues to design powerful computational imaging systems.},

Here, we present an approach that couples ex vivo high-throughput screenings of cancer biopsies using microfluidics with logic-based modeling to generate patient-specific dynamic models of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathways. We used the resulting models to investigate heterogeneity in pancreatic cancer patients, showing dissimilarities especially in the PI3K-Akt pathway. Variation in model parameters reflected well the different tumor stages. Finally, we used our dynamic models to efficaciously predict new personalized combinatorial treatments.

@article{Gillespie1977,
abstract = {There are two formalisms for mathematically describing the time behavior of a spatially homogeneous chemical system: The deterministic approach regards the time evolution as a continuous, wholly predictable process which is governed by a set of coupled, ordinary differential equations (the “reaction-rate equations”); the stochastic approach regards the time evolution as a kind of random-walk process which is governed by a single dif- ferential-difference equation (the “master equation”). Fairly simple kinetic theory arguments show that the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics has a firmer physical basis than the deterministic formulation, but unfortunately the stochastic master equation is often mathematically intractable. There is, however, a way to make exact numerical calculations within the framework of the stochastic formulation without having to deal with the master equation directly. It is a relatively simple digital computer algorithm which uses a rigorously derived Monte Carlo procedure to numerically simulate the time evolution of the given chemical system. Like the master equation, this “stochastic simulation algorithm” correctly accounts for the inherent fluctuations and correlations that are necessarily ignored in the deterministic formulation. In addition, unlike most procedures for numerically solving the deterministic reaction-rate equations, this algorithm never approximates infinitesimal time increments dt by finite time steps At. The feasibility and utility of the simulation algorithm are demonstrated by applying it to several well-known model chemical systems, including the Lotka model, the Brusselator, and the Oregonator.},

abstract = {Fluorescence is a powerful and sensitive tool in biological detection, used widely for cellular imaging and in vitro molecular diagnostics. Over time, three prominent conventions have emerged in the design of fluorescent biosensors: a sensor is ideally specific for its target, only one fluorescence signal turns on or off in response to the target, and each target requires its own sensor and signal combination. These are conventions but not requirements, and sensors that break with one or more of these conventions can offer new capabilities and advantages. Here, we review "unconventional" fluorescent sensor configurations based on fluorescent dyes, proteins, and nanomaterials such as quantum dots and metal nanoclusters. These configurations include multifluorophore Fö rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) networks, temporal multiplexing, photonic logic, and cross-reactive arrays or "noses". The more complex but carefully engineered biorecognition and fluorescence signaling modalities in unconventional designs are richer in information, afford greater multiplexing capacity, and are potentially better suited to the analysis of complex biological samples, interactions, processes, and diseases. We conclude with a short perspective on the future of unconventional fluorescent sensors and encourage researchers to imagine sensing beyond the metaphorical light bulb and light switch combination.},

abstract = {Stochastic fluctuations in gene expression give rise to cell-to-cell variability in protein levels which can potentially cause variability in cellular phenotype. For TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) variability manifests itself as dramatic differences in the time between ligand exposure and the sudden activation of the effector caspases that kill cells. However, the contribution of individual proteins to phenotypic variability has not been explored in detail. In this paper we use feature-based sensitivity analysis as a means to estimate the impact of variation in key apoptosis regulators on variability in the dynamics of cell death. We use Monte Carlo sampling from measured protein concentration distributions in combination with a previously validated ordinary differential equation model of apoptosis to simulate the dynamics of receptor-mediated apoptosis. We find that variation in the concentrations of some proteins matters much more than variation in others and that precisely which proteins matter depends both on the concentrations of other proteins and on whether correlations in protein levels are taken into account. A prediction from simulation that we confirm experimentally is that variability in fate is sensitive to even small increases in the levels of Bcl-2. We also show that sensitivity to Bcl-2 levels is itself sensitive to the levels of interacting proteins. The contextual dependency is implicit in the mathematical formulation of sensitivity, but our data show that it is also important for biologically relevant parameter values. Our work provides a conceptual and practical means to study and understand the impact of cell-to-cell variability in protein expression levels on cell fate using deterministic models and sampling from parameter distributions.},

In order to understand the regulation of cells, time series expression profiles provide a more complete picture than single time point expression profiles. Few analysis techniques, however, are well suited to modelling such time series data. RESULTS: We describe an approach that naturally handles time series data with the capabilities of modelling causality, feedback loops, and environmental or hidden variables using a Dynamic Bayesian network. We also present a novel way of combining prior biological knowledge and current observations to improve the quality of analysis and to model interactions between sets of genes rather than individual genes. Our approach is evaluated on time series expression data measured in response to physiological changes that affect tryptophan metabolism in E. coli. Results indicate that this approach is capable of finding correlations between sets of related genes.},

abstract = {Studies performed at single-cell resolution have demonstrated the physiological 11 significance of cell-to-cell variability. Various types of mathematical models and systems analyses 12 of biological networks have further been used to gain a better understanding of the sources and 13 regulatory mechanisms of such variability. In this work, we present a novel sensitivity analysis 14 method, called molecular density function perturbation (MDFP), for the dynamical analysis of 15 cellular heterogeneity. The proposed analysis is based on introducing perturbations to the density 16 or distribution function of the cellular state variables at specific time points, and quantifying how 17 such perturbations affect the state distribution at later time points. We applied the MDFP analysis 18 to a model of signal transduction pathway of Hela cells undergoing TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The 19 MDFP analysis suggested that caspase-8 activation regulates the timing of the switch-like increase 20 of cPARP (cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase), an indicator of apoptosis. However, the 21 cell-to-cell variability in the commitment to apoptosis depended on mitochondrial outer membrane 22 permeabilization (MOMP) and events following MOMP, including the release of Smac (second 23 mitochondria-derived activator of caspases) and cytochrome-C release from mitochondria and the 24 inhibition of XIAP by Smac. 25 Keywords: keyword 1; keyword 2; keyword 3 (List three to ten pertinent keywords specific to the 26 article; yet reasonably common within the subject discipline.)},

abstract = {The extrinsic apoptotic pathway is initiated by death receptor activation. Death receptor activation leads to the formation of death receptor signaling platforms, resulting in the demolition of the cell. Despite the fact that death receptor-mediated apoptosis has been studied to a high level of detail, its quantitative regulation until recently has been poorly understood. This situation has dramatically changed in the last years. Creation of mathematical models of death receptor signaling led to an enormous progress in the quantitative understanding of the network regulation and provided fascinating insights into the mechanisms of apoptosis control. In the following sections, the models of the death receptor signaling and their biological implications will be addressed. Central attention will be given to the models of CD95/Fas/APO-1, an exemplified member of the death receptor signaling pathways. The CD95 death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and regulation of CD95 DISC activity by its key inhibitor c-FLIP, have been vigorously investigated by modeling approaches, and therefore will be the major topic here. Furthermore, the non-linear dynamics of the DISC, positive feedback loops and bistability as well as stoichiometric switches in extrinsic apoptosis will be discussed. Collectively, this review gives a comprehensive view how the mathematical modeling supported by quantitative experimental approaches has provided a new understanding of the death receptor signaling network.},

Quantifying cell morphology is fundamental to the statistical study of cell populations, and can help unravel mechanisms underlying cell and tissue morphogenesis. Current methods, however, require extensive human intervention, are highly parameter sensitive, or produce metrics that are difficult to interpret biologically.We therefore developed a method, lobe contribution elliptical Fourier analysis (LOCO-EFA), which generates from digitalised two-dimensional cell outlines meaningful descriptors that can be directly matched to morphological features. This is shown by studying well-defined geometric shapes as well as actual biological cells from plant and animal tissues. LOCO-EFA provides a tool to phenotype efficiently and objectively populations of cells, here demonstrated by applying it to the complex shaped pavement cells of Arabidopsis thaliana wildtype and speechless leaves, and Drosophila amnioserosa cells. To validate our method's applicability to large populations, we analysed computer-generated tissues. By controlling in silico cell shape, we explored the potential impact of cell packing on individual cell shape, quantifying through LOCO-EFA deviations between the specified shape of single cells in isolation and the resultant shape when they interact within a confluent tissue.},

Long-term depression, a proposed physiological correlate of synapse elimination, requires caspase-3 and the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Here, we show that caspase-3 activity is essential-and can act locally within neurons-for regulation of spine density and dendrite morphology. By photostimulation of Mito-KillerRed, we induced caspase-3 activity in defined dendritic regions of cultured neurons. Within the photostimulated region, local elimination of dendritic spines and dendrite retraction occurred in a caspase-3-dependent manner without inducing cell death. However, pharmacological inhibition of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins or proteasome function led to neuronal death, suggesting that caspase activation is spatially restricted by these "molecular brakes" on apoptosis. Caspase-3 knock-out mice have increased spine density and altered miniature EPSCs, confirming a physiological involvement of caspase-3 in the regulation of spines in vivo.},

abstract = {Theory and experiment suggest that organisms can pre-adapt to future stressors based on reproducible environmental fluctuations experienced by their ancestors. Yet the mechanisms driving such pre-adaptation remain enigmatic. We report that the [SMAUG+] prion allows yeast to anticipate nutrient repletion after periods of starvation, providing a strong selective advantage. By transforming the landscape of post-transcriptional gene expression, [SMAUG+] regulates the decision between two broad growth and survival strategies: mitotic proliferation or meiotic differentiation into a stress-resistant state. [SMAUG+] is common in laboratory yeast strains, where standard propagation practice produces regular cycles of nutrient scarcity followed by repletion. Distinct [SMAUG+] variants are also widespread in wild yeast isolates from multiple niches, establishing that prion polymorphs can be utilized in natural populations. Our data provide a striking example of how protein-based epigenetic switches can be hidden in plain sight and can establish a transgenerational memory that integrates adaptive prediction into developmental decisions.},

abstract = {Single-cell RNA and protein concentrations dynamically fluctuate because of stochastic ("noisy") regulation. Consequently, biological signaling and genetic networks not only translate stimuli with functional response but also random fluctuations. Intuitively, this feature manifests as the accumulation of fluctuations from the network source to the target. Taking advantage of the fact that noise propagates directionally, we developed a method for causation prediction that does not require time-lagged observations and therefore can be applied to data generated by destructive assays such as immunohistochemistry. Our method for causation prediction, "Inference of Network Directionality Using Covariance Elements (INDUCE)," exploits the theoretical relationship between a change in the strength of a causal interaction and the associated changes in the single cell measured entries of the covariance matrix of protein concentrations. We validated our method for causation prediction in two experimental systems where causation is well established: in an E. coli synthetic gene network, and in MEK to ERK signaling in mammalian cells. We report the first analysis of covariance elements documenting noise propagation from a kinase to a phosphorylated substrate in an endogenous mammalian signaling network.},

Here we present a mechanistic mathematical model, formulated on the basis of newly emerging information, describing key elements of receptor-mediated and stress-induced caspase activation. We have used mass-conservation principles in conjunction with kinetic rate laws to formulate ordinary differential equations that describe the temporal evolution of caspase activation. Qualitative strategies for the prevention of caspase activation are simulated and compared with experimental data. We show that model predictions are consistent with available information. Thus, the model could aid in better understanding caspase activation and identifying therapeutic approaches promoting or retarding apoptotic cell death.},

abstract = {Modular Response Analysis (MRA) is a suite of methods that under certain assumptions permits the precise reconstruction of both the directions and strengths of connections between network modules from network responses to perturbations. Standard MRA assumes that modules are insulated, thereby neglecting the existence of inter-modular protein complexes. Such complexes sequester proteins from different modules and propagate perturbations to the protein abundance of a downstream module retroactively to an upstream module. MRA-based network reconstruction detects retroactive, sequestration-induced connections when an enzyme from one module is substantially sequestered by its substrate that belongs to a different module. Moreover, inferred networks may surprisingly depend on the choice of protein abundances that are experimentally perturbed, and also some inferred connections might be false. Here, we extend MRA by introducing a combined computational and experimental approach, which allows for a computational restoration of modular insulation, unmistakable network reconstruction and discrimination between solely regulatory and sequestration-induced connections for a range of signaling pathways. Although not universal, our approach extends MRA methods to signaling networks with retroactive interactions between modules arising from enzyme sequestration effects.},

abstract = {The widespread success in using genetically encoded fluorescent proteins (FPs) to track protein motion in living cells has led to extensive interest in measuring F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between two FPs of different colors. FRET occurs over distances less than 10-nm and can thus be used to detect protein-protein interactions and changes in protein conformation. However, FP-FRET measurements are complicated by the spectral properties of FPs. Consequently, extensive correction or photo-destructive approaches have been used to detect the presence of FRET. Since these methods limit the temporal and spatial resolution of FRET measurements, they are not well suited for many live-cell imaging applications. Here, we describe an alternative approach to detect FP-FRET by measuring fluorescence anisotropies (AFRET).Since FPs are large in size, excitation of FPs with polarized light results in highly polarized emission. In this case, FRET to a second FP that lies outside the photoselection plane will depolarize the fluorescence. This method provides high contrast and unambiguous indication of FRET using a simple image collection strategy that can be easily adapted to any modality including widefield and laser scanning approaches. In this chapter, we will discuss the theory behind AFRET imaging, calculation of FP anisotropies using fluorescent microscopes, and configuration of microscopes for AFRET experiments. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

However, very little is known about their role in dynamic, nonphysically destructive processes, such as axonal arborization and synaptogenesis. We show that caspases were locally active in vivo at the branch points of young, dynamic retinal ganglion cell axonal arbors but not in the cell body or in stable mature arbors. Caspase activation, dependent on Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), rapidly increased at branch points corresponding with branch tip addition. Time-lapse imaging revealed that knockdown of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 led to more stable arbors and presynaptic sites. Genetic analysis showed that Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and p38 MAPK interacted with Slit1a-Robo2 signaling, suggesting that localized activation of caspases lie downstream of a ligand receptor system, acting as key promoters of axonal branch tip and synaptic dynamics to restrict arbor growth in vivo in the central nervous system.},

abstract = {Notch pathway haploinsufficiency can cause severe developmental syndromes with highly variable penetrance. Currently, we have a limited mechanistic understanding of phenotype variability due to gene dosage. Here, we unexpectedly found that inserting an enhancer containing pioneer transcription factor sites coupled to Notch dimer sites can induce a subset of Notch haploinsufficiency phenotypes in Drosophila with wild type Notch gene dose. Using Drosophila genetics, we show that this enhancer induces Notch phenotypes in a Cdk8-dependent, transcription-independent manner. We further combined mathematical modeling with quantitative trait and expression analysis to build a model that describes how changes in Notch signal production versus degradation differentially impact cellular outcomes that require long versus short signal duration. Altogether, these findings support a "bind and discard" mechanism in which enhancers with specific binding sites promote rapid Cdk8-dependent Notch turnover, and thereby reduce Notch-dependent transcription at other loci and sensitize tissues to gene dose based upon signal duration.},

abstract = {Phase recovery from intensity-only measurements forms the heart of coherent imaging techniques and holography. Here we demonstrate that a neural network can learn to perform phase recovery and holographic image reconstruction after appropriate training. This deep learning-based approach provides an entirely new framework to conduct holographic imaging by rapidly eliminating twin-image and self-interference related spatial artifacts. Compared to existing approaches, this neural network based method is significantly faster to compute, and reconstructs improved phase and amplitude images of the objects using only one hologram, i.e., requires less number of measurements in addition to being computationally faster. We validated this method by reconstructing phase and amplitude images of various samples, including blood and Pap smears, and tissue sections. These results are broadly applicable to any phase recovery problem, and highlight that through machine learning challenging problems in imaging science can be overcome, providing new avenues to design powerful computational imaging systems.},

To quantify how noise propagates through gene networks, we measured expression correlations between genes in single cells. We found that noise in a gene was determined by its intrinsic fluctuations, transmitted noise from upstream genes, and global noise affecting all genes. A model was developed that explains the complex behavior exhibited by the correlations and reveals the dominant noise sources. The model successfully predicts the correlations as the network is systematically perturbed. This approach provides a step toward understanding and manipulating noise propagation in more complex gene networks.},

abstract = {The production of proteins from mRNAs localized at the synapse ultimately controls the strength of synaptic transmission, thereby affecting behavior and cognitive functions. The regulated transcription, processing, and transport of mRNAs provide dynamic control of the dendritic transcriptome, which includes thousands of messengers encoding multiple cellular functions. Translation is locally modulated by synaptic activity through a complex network of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and various types of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) including BC-RNAs, microRNAs, piwi-interacting RNAs, and small interference RNAs. The RBPs FMRP and CPEB play a well-established role in synaptic translation, and additional regulatory factors are emerging. The mRNA repressors Smaug, Nanos, and Pumilio define a novel pathway for local translational control that affects dendritic branching and spines in both flies and mammals. Recent findings support a role for processing bodies and related synaptic mRNA-silencing foci (SyAS-foci) in the modulation of synaptic plasticity and memory formation. The SyAS-foci respond to different stimuli with changes in their integrity thus enabling regulated mRNA release followed by translation. CPEB, Pumilio, TDP-43, and FUS/TLS form multimers through low-complexity regions related to prion domains or polyQ expansions. The oligomerization of these repressor RBPs is mechanistically linked to the aggregation of abnormal proteins commonly associated with neurodegeneration. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on how specificity in mRNA translation is achieved through the concerted action of multiple pathways that involve regulatory ncRNAs and RBPs, the modification of translation factors, and mRNA-silencing foci dynamics.},

abstract = {P-bodies are cytoplasmic granules that are linked to mRNA decay, mRNA storage, and RNA interference (RNAi). They are known to interact with stress granules in stressed cells, and with late endosomes. Here, we report that P-bodies also interact with mitochondria, as previously described for P-body-related granules in germ cells. The interaction is dynamic, as a large majority of P-bodies contacts mitochondria at least once within a 3-min interval, and for about 18 s. This association requires an intact microtubule network. The depletion of P-bodies does not seem to affect mitochondria, nor the mitochondrial activity to be required for their contacts with P-bodies. However, inactivation of mitochondria leads to a strong decrease of miRNA-mediated RNAi efficiency, and to a lesser extent of siRNA-mediated RNAi. The defect occurs during the assembly of active RISC and is associated with a specific delocalization of endogeneous Ago2 from P-bodies. Our study reveals the possible involvement of RNAi defect in pathologies involving mitochondrial deficiencies.},

abstract = {Rho GTPase-based signaling networks control cellular dynamics by coordinating protrusions and retractions in space and time. Here, we reveal a signaling network that generates pulses and propagating waves of cell contractions. These dynamic patterns emerge via self-organization from an activator-inhibitor network, in which the small GTPase Rho amplifies its activity by recruiting its activator, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1. Rho also inhibits itself by local recruitment of actomyosin and the associated RhoGAP Myo9b. This network structure enables spontaneous, self-limiting patterns of subcellular contractility that can explore mechanical cues in the extracellular environment. Indeed, actomyosin pulse frequency in cells is altered by matrix elasticity, showing that coupling of contractility pulses to environmental deformations modulates network dynamics. Thus, our study reveals a mechanism that integrates intracellular biochemical and extracellular mechanical signals into subcellular activity patterns to control cellular contractility dynamics.},

This was achieved by measuring the extent of fluorescence resonance energy transfer within a recombinant substrate containing cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) linked by a short peptide possessing the caspase-3 cleavage sequence, DEVD, to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; i.e. CFP-DEVD-YFP). We demonstrate that, once initiated, the activation of caspase-3 is a very rapid process, taking 5 min or less to reach completion. Furthermore, this process occurs almost simultaneously with a depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential. These events occur just prior to the characteristic morphological changes associated with apoptosis. Our results clearly demonstrate that, once initiated, the commitment of cells to apoptosis is a remarkably rapid event when visualized at the single cell level.},

We transfected HeLa cells with a recombinant caspase substrate composed of cyan and yellow fluorescent protein and a linker peptide containing the caspase cleavage sequence DEVD, and we examined the cleavage kinetics at the single-cell level by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis. Caspase activation in response to tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$, staurosporine, or etoposide resulted in cleavage of the linker peptide and subsequent disruption of the FRET signal. The time to caspase activation varied among individual cells, depending on the type of treatment and concentration used. However, once initiated, disruption of the FRET signal was always rapid (≤15 min) and largely independent of these parameters. In contrast, FRET probe cleavage was significantly slower in the caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells, particularly at low concentrations of the pro-apoptotic agents. Under these conditions, MCF-7 cells required up to 90 min for the FRET probe cleavage, whereas MCF-7/Casp-3 cells displayed rapid cleavage kinetics. Interestingly, we could still observe comparable cell death rates in MCF-7 and MCF-7/Casp-3 cells. Our results suggest that caspase activation during apoptosis occurs in an "all or nothing" fashion. Caspase-3 is required for rapid cleavage kinetics when the onset of apoptosis is slow, suggesting the existence of caspase-3-dependent feedback loops.},

abstract = {Apoptosis in response to the ligand CD95L (also known as Fas ligand) is initiated by caspase-8, which is activated by dimerization and self-cleavage at death-inducing signaling complexes (DISCs). Previous work indicated that the degree of substrate cleavage by caspase-8 determines whether a cell dies or survives in response to a death stimulus. To determine how a death ligand stimulus is effectively translated into caspase-8 activity, we assessed this activity over time in single cells with compartmentalized probes that are cleaved by caspase-8 and used multiscale modeling to simultaneously describe single-cell and population data with an ensemble of single-cell models. We derived and experimentally validated a minimal model in which cleavage of caspase-8 in the enzymatic domain occurs in an interdimeric manner through interaction between DISCs, whereas prodomain cleavage sites are cleaved in an intradimeric manner within DISCs. Modeling indicated that sustained membrane-bound caspase-8 activity is followed by transient cytosolic activity, which can be interpreted as a molecular timer mechanism reflected by a limited lifetime of active caspase-8. The activation of caspase-8 by combined intra- and interdimeric cleavage ensures weak signaling at low concentrations of CD95L and strongly accelerated activation at higher ligand concentrations, thereby contributing to precise control of apoptosis.},

abstract = {Processing bodies (PBs) and Stress Granules (SGs) are the founding members of a new class of RNA granules, known as mRNA silencing foci, as they harbour transcripts circumstantially excluded from the translationally active pool. PBs and SGs are able to release mRNAs thus allowing their translation. PBs are constitutive, but respond to stimuli that affect mRNA translation and decay, whereas SGs are specifically induced upon cellular stress, which triggers a global translational silencing by several pathways, including phosphorylation of the key translation initiation factor eIF2alpha, and tRNA cleavage among others. PBs and SGs with different compositions may coexist in a single cell. These macromolecular aggregates are highly conserved through evolution, from unicellular organisms to vertebrate neurons. Their dynamics is regulated by several signaling pathways, and depends on microfilaments and microtubules, and the cognate molecular motors myosin, dynein, and kinesin. SGs share features with aggresomes and related aggregates of unfolded proteins frequently present in neurodegenerative diseases, and may play a role in the pathology. Virus infections may induce or impair SG formation. Besides being important for mRNA regulation upon stress, SGs modulate the signaling balancing apoptosis and cell survival. Finally, the formation of Nuclear Stress Bodies (nSBs), which share components with SGs, and the assembly of additional cytosolic aggregates containing RNA -the UV granules and the Ire1 foci-, all of them induced by specific cell damage factors, contribute to cell survival. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

We created an Apollo sensor for NADP(+) (Apollo-NADP(+)) that exploits NADP(+)-dependent homodimerization of enzymatically inactive glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD).

Multivariate analysis of single-cell data helps describe the variation in expression accompanying cellular processes during embryonic development, disease progression and in response to stimuli. Likewise, new methods have extended the possibilities of single-cell analysis by measuring the transcriptome while simultaneously capturing information on lineage or past molecular events. These emerging approaches have the common strategy of querying a static snapshot for information related to different temporal stages. Single-cell temporal-omics methods open new possibilities such as extrapolating the future or correlating past events to present gene expression. We highlight advancements in the single-cell field, describe novel toolkits for investigation, and consider the potential impact of temporal-omics approaches for the study of disease progression.},

abstract = {The goal of many single-cell studies on eukaryotic cells is to gain insight into the biochemical reactions that control cell fate and state. In this paper we introduce the concept of effective stoichiometric space (ESS) to guide the reconstruction of biochemical networks from multiplexed, fixed time-point, single-cell data. In contrast to methods based solely on statistical models of data, the ESS method leverages the power of the geometric theory of toric varieties to begin unraveling the structure of chemical reaction networks (CRN). This application of toric theory enables a data-driven mapping of covariance relationships in single cell measurements into stoichiometric information, one in which each cell subpopulation has its associated ESS interpreted in terms of CRN theory. In the development of ESS we reframe certain aspects of the theory of CRN to better match data analysis. As an application of our approach we process cytomery- and image-based single-cell datasets and identify differences in cells treated with kinase inhibitors. Our approach is directly applicable to data acquired using readily accessible experimental methods such as Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) and multiplex immunofluorescence.

Author summary We introduce a new notion, which we call the effective stoichiometric space (ESS), that elucidates network structure from the covariances of single-cell multiplexed data. The ESS approach differs from methods that are based on purely statistical models of data: it allows a completely new and data-driven translation of the theory of toric varieties in geometry and specifically their role in chemical reaction networks (CRN). In the process, we reframe certain aspects of the theory of CRN. As illustrations of our approach, we find stoichiometry in different single-cell datasets, and pinpoint dose-dependence of network perturbations in drug-treated cells.},

The confocal microscope's ability to block out-of-focus light and thereby perform optical sectioning through a specimen allows the researcher to quantify fluorescence with very high spatial precision. However, generating meaningful data using confocal microscopy requires careful planning and a thorough understanding of the technique. In this tutorial, the researcher is guided through all aspects of acquiring quantitative confocal microscopy images, including optimizing sample preparation for fixed and live cells, choosing the most suitable microscope for a given application and configuring the microscope parameters. Suggestions are offered for planning unbiased and rigorous confocal microscope experiments. Common pitfalls such as photobleaching and cross-talk are addressed, as well as several troubling instrumentation problems that may prevent the acquisition of quantitative data. Finally, guidelines for analyzing and presenting confocal images in a way that maintains the quantitative nature of the data are presented, and statistical analysis is discussed.

Since switch-like behaviors are required for models that attempt to explain the all-or-none decisions of apoptosis, ultrasensitivity was employed as a criterion for comparison. Our results successfully exhibit that the direct activation model operates more reliably to achieve a robust switch in cellular conditions. Moreover, by investigating the robustness of other important features of the Bcl-2 apoptotic switch (including low Bax basal activation, inhibitory role of anti-apoptotic proteins and insensitivity to small perturbations) the direct activation model was further supported. In all, we identified the direct activation model as a more plausible explanation for the Bcl-2 apoptotic switch. {\textcopyright} 2007 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.},

abstract = {The crypts of the intestinal epithelium house the stem cells that ensure the continual renewal of the epithelial cells that line the intestinal tract. Crypt number increases by a process called crypt fission, the division of a single crypt into two daughter crypts. Fission drives normal tissue growth and maintenance. Correspondingly, it becomes less frequent in adulthood. Importantly, fission is reactivated to drive adenoma growth. The mechanisms governing fission are poorly understood. However, only by knowing how normal fission operates can cancer-associated changes be elucidated. We studied normal fission in tissue in three dimensions using high-resolution imaging and used intestinal organoids to identify underlying mechanisms. We discovered that both the number and relative position of Paneth cells and Lgr5+ cells are important for fission. Furthermore, the higher stiffness and increased adhesion of Paneth cells are involved in determining the site of fission. Formation of a cluster of Lgr5+ cells between at least two Paneth-cell-rich domains establishes the site for the upward invagination that initiates fission.},

abstract = {Multicellular organisms shape development and remove aberrant cells by programmed cell death ("apoptosis"). Because defective cell death (too little or too much) is implicated in various diseases (like cancer and autoimmunity), understanding how apoptosis is regulated is an important goal of molecular cell biologists. To this end, we propose a mathematical model of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway that captures three key dynamical features: a signal threshold to elicit cell death, irreversible commitment to the response, and a time delay that is inversely proportional to signal strength. Subdividing the intrinsic pathway into three modules (initiator, amplifier, executioner), we use computer simulation and bifurcation theory to attribute signal threshold and time delay to positive feedback in the initiator module and irreversible commitment to positive feedback in the executioner module. The model accounts for the behavior of mutants deficient in various genes and is used to design experiments that would test its basic assumptions. Finally, we apply the model to study p53-induced cellular responses to DNA damage. Cells first undergo cell cycle arrest and DNA repair, and then apoptosis if the damage is beyond repair. The model ascribes this cell-fate transition to a transformation of p53 from "helper" to "killer" forms. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). High-throughput quantitative phase imaging (QPI) is essential to cellular phenotypes characterization as it allows high-content cell analysis and avoids adverse effects of staining reagents on cellular viability and cell signaling. Among different approaches, Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) is probably the most promising technique to realize high-throughput QPI by synthesizing a wide-field, high-resolution complex image from multiple angle-variably illuminated, low-resolution images. However, the large dataset requirement in conventional FPM significantly limits its imaging speed, resulting in low temporal throughput. Moreover, the underlying theoretical mechanism as well as optimum illumination scheme for high-accuracy phase imaging in FPM remains unclear. Herein, we report a high-speed FPM technique based on programmable annular illuminations (AIFPM). The optical-transfer-function (OTF) analysis of FPM reveals that the low-frequency phase information can only be correctly recovered if the LEDs are precisely located at the edge of the objective numerical aperture (NA) in the frequency space. By using only 4 low-resolution images corresponding to 4 tilted illuminations matching a 10×, 0.4 NA objective, we present the high-speed imaging results of in vitro Hela cells mitosis and apoptosis at a frame rate of 25 Hz with a full-pitch resolution of 655 nm at a wavelength of 525 nm (effective NA = 0.8) across a wide field-of-view (FOV) of 1.77 mm2, corresponding to a space-bandwidth-time product of 411 megapixels per second. Our work reveals an important capability of FPM towards high-speed high-throughput imaging of in vitro live cells, achieving video-rate QPI performance across a wide range of scales, both spatial and temporal.},

abstract = {In systems biology, a mathematical description of signal transduction processes is used to gain a more detailed mechanistic understanding of cellular signaling networks. Such models typically depend on a number of parameters that have different influence on the model behavior. Local sensitivity analysis is able to identify parameters that have the largest effect on signaling strength. Bifurcation analysis shows on which parameters a qualitative model response depends. Most methods for model analysis are intrinsically univariate. They typically cannot consider combinations of parameters since the search space for such analysis would be too large. This limitation is important since activation of a signaling pathway often relies on multiple rather than on single factors. Here, we present a novel method for model analysis that overcomes this limitation. As input to a model defined by a system of ordinary differential equations, we consider parameters for initial chemical species concentrations. The model is used to simulate the system response, which is then classified into pre-defined classes (e.g., active or not active). This is combined with a scan of the parameter space. Parameter sets leading to a certain system response are subjected to a decision tree algorithm, which learns conditions that lead to this response. We compare our method to two alternative multivariate approaches to model analysis: analytical solution for steady states combined with a parameter scan, and direct Lyapunov exponent (DLE) analysis. We use three previously published models including a model for EGF receptor internalization and two apoptosis models to demonstrate the power of our approach. Our method reproduces critical parameter relations previously obtained by both steady-state and DLE analysis while being more generally applicable and substantially less computationally expensive. The method can be used as a general tool to predict multivariate control strategies for pathway activation and to suggest strategies for drug intervention.},

We start this review by describing three techniques that can be used for this purpose: (i) affinity-tagged proteins (ii) the two-hybrid system and (iii) some quantitative proteomic techniques that can be used in combination with, e.g., affinity chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation for screening of protein-protein interactions.

Four strategies for validation of protein-protein interactions are presented: confocal microscopy for intracellular colocalization of proteins, coimmunoprecipitation, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and spectroscopic studies.

abstract = {Organ function depends on tissues adopting the correct architecture. However, insights into organ architecture are currently hampered by an absence of standardized quantitative 3D analysis. We aimed to develop a robust technology to visualize, digitalize, and segment the architecture of two tubular systems in 3D: d o u ble resin c asting micro computed t omography (DUCT). As proof of principle, we applied DUCT to a mouse model for Alagille syndrome ( Jag1 Ndr/Ndr mice), characterized by intrahepatic bile duct paucity, that can spontaneously generate a biliary system in adulthood. DUCT identified increased central biliary branching and peripheral bile duct tortuosity as two compensatory processes occurring in distinct regions of Jag1 Ndr/Ndr liver, leading to full reconstitution of wild-type biliary volume and phenotypic recovery. DUCT is thus a powerful new technology for 3D analysis, which can reveal novel phenotypes and provide a standardized method of defining liver architecture in mouse models.},

abstract = {Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is one of the most general and adaptable single-molecule techniques. Despite the explosive growth in the application of smFRET to answer biological questions in the last decade, the technique has been practiced mostly by biophysicists. We provide a practical guide to using smFRET, focusing on the study of immobilized molecules that allow measurements of single-molecule reaction trajectories from 1 ms to many minutes. We discuss issues a biologist must consider to conduct successful smFRET experiments, including experimental design, sample preparation, single-molecule detection and data analysis. We also describe how a smFRET-capable instrument can be built at a reasonable cost with off-the-shelf components and operated reliably using well-established protocols and freely available software},

@article{Sachs2005b,
abstract = {Machine learning was applied for the automated derivation of causal influ- ences in cellular signaling networks. This derivation relied on the simultaneous measurement of multiple phosphorylated protein and phospholipid components in thousands of individual primary human immune system cells. Perturbing these cells with molecular interventions drove the ordering of connections between pathway components, wherein Bayesian network computational methods auto- matically elucidated most of the traditionally reported signaling relationships and predicted novel interpathway network causalities, which we verified ex- perimentally. Reconstruction of network models from physiologically relevant primary single cells might be applied to understanding native-state tissue signal- ing biology, complex drug actions, and dysfunctional signaling in diseased cells.},

@article{Mehta2018c,
abstract = {Unravelling the dynamic molecular interplay behind complex physiological processes such as neuronal plasticity requires the ability to both detect minute changes in biochemical states in response to physiological signals and track multiple signalling activities simultaneously. Fluorescent protein-based biosensors have enabled the real-time monitoring of dynamic signalling processes within the native context of living cells, yet most commonly used biosensors exhibit poor sensitivity (for example, due to low dynamic range) and are limited to imaging signalling activities in isolation. Here, we address this challenge by developing a suite of excitation ratiometric kinase activity biosensors that offer the highest reported dynamic range and enable the detection of subtle changes in signalling activity that could not be reliably detected previously, as well as a suite of single-fluorophore biosensors that enable the simultaneous tracking of as many as six distinct signalling activities in single living cells.},

@article{Borten2018,
abstract = {Spheroid and organoid cultures are powerful in vitro models for biology, but size and shape diversity within the culture is largely ignored. To streamline morphometric profiling, we developed OrganoSeg, an open-source software that integrates segmentation, filtering, and analysis for archived brightfield images of 3D culture. OrganoSeg is more accurate and flexible than existing platforms, and we illustrate its potential by stratifying 5167 breast-cancer spheroid and 5743 colon and colorectal-cancer organoid morphologies. Organoid transcripts grouped by morphometric signature heterogeneity were enriched for biological processes not prominent in the original RNA sequencing data. OrganoSeg enables complete, objective quantification of brightfield phenotypes, which may give insight into the molecular and multicellular mechanisms of organoid regulation.},
